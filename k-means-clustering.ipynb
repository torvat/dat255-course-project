    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reach a certain length of text to summarize, the other methods become too expensive or are not able to summarize well enough. We need to find a way to extract all the important parts of large texts like books or very big documents, and create a summary from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some simple ways to avoid using all the chunks for summarization is either randomly selecting chunks, or spacing out which chunks are selected. But what if we miss out on an important part of the text while doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution is K-means clustering, where each chunk is embedded, and then clusters are formed based on semantic meaning of those chunks. Then a summary is formed from each cluster, hopefully netting us a more accurate summary of huge texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is the amount of requests sent to the API. While Map Reduction sends many requests, clustering will send only one request, saving a lot of money."

In the old days  there were stirring times, when the \\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hor des, and the patriots went out to \\nmeet them, men and women, the aged a nd the children too, and waited their \\ncoming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on \\nthem with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he \\nfound but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.\"  \"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there \\nis a sure index to it if men will but ta ke the trouble to look?\" The Count smiled, \\nand as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out \\nstrangely. He answered:  \\n\"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only \\nappear on one night, and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, \\nstir without his doors. A nd, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to \\ndo. Why, even the peasant that you te ll me of who marked the place of the \\nflame would not know where to look in da ylight even for his own work. Even \\nyou would not, I dare be  sworn, be able to find these places again?\"  \\n\"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even to \\nlook for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.  \\n\"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of  London and of the house which you \\nhave procured for me.\" With an apolo gy for my remissness, I went into my \\nown room to get the papers from my ba g. Whilst I was placing them in order I \\nheard a rattling of china and silver in th e next room, and as I passed through, \\nnoticed that the table had been cleared a nd the lamp lit, for it was by this time \\ndeep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or li brary, and I found \\nthe Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English \\nBradshaw\\'s Guide. When I came in he cl eared the books and papers from the \\ntable, and with him I went in to plans and deeds and figu res of all sorts. He was \\ninterested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and \\nits surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the \\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he ev idently at the end knew very much more \\nthan I did. When I remarked this, he answered.  \\n\"Well, but, my friend, is it not n eedful that I should ? When I go there I \\nshall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan, nay, pardon me. I fall into my country\\'s habit of putting your patronymic first, my friend Jonathan Harker \\nwill not be by my side to correct and ai d me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, \\nprobably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. \\nSo!\"  \\nWe went thoroughly into the business of  the purchase of the estate at \\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary \\npapers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he \\nbegan to ask me how I had come across so  suitable a place. I read to him the \\nnotes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here.  \"At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came acros s just such a place as seemed to be \\nrequired, and where was displayed a d ilapidated notice that the place was for \\nsale. It was surrounded by a high wall, of  ancient structure, built of heavy \\nstones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates \\nare of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.  \\n\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face, \\nas the house is four sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It \\ncontains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by th e solid stone wall \\nabove mentioned. There are many trees on  it, which make it in places gloomy, \\nand there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some \\nsprings, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house \\nis very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediaeval times, for one \\npart is of stone immensely thick, w ith only a few windows high up and heavily \\nbarred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or \\nchurch. I could not enter it,  as I had not the key of the door leading to it from \\nthe house, but I have taken with my Koda k views of it from various points. The \\nhouse had been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at \\nthe amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few \\nhouses close at hand, one being a very  large house only recently added to and \\nformed into a private lunatic asylum. It  is not, however, visible from the \\ngrounds.\"  \\nWhen I had finished, he said, \"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am \\nof an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be \\nmade habitable in a day, and after all, how few days go to make up a century. I \\nrejoice also that there is a chapel of  old times. We Transylvanian nobles love \\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety \\nnor mirth, not the bright volu ptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters \\nwhich please the young and gay. I am no longer young, and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mi rth. Moreover, the \\nwalls of my castle are broken. The sh adows are many, and the wind breathes \\ncold through the broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the \\nshadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his \\nwords and his look did not s eem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face \\nmade his smile look malignant and saturnine.  \\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me , asking me to pull my papers together. \\nHe was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around \\nme. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally to England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings \\nmarked, and on examining these I noticed th at one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated. The other two were Exeter, \\nand Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.  \\nIt was the better part of an hour when  the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he said. \\n\"Still at your books? G ood! But you must not work always. Come! I am \\ninformed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into the '),\n",

I went down even into the vaults, where the \\ndim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of \\nthese I went, but saw nothing except fragme nts of old coffins and piles of dust. \\nIn the third, however, I made a discovery.  \\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile \\nof newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asl eep. I could not say which, for eyes were open and stony, bu t without the glassiness of death, and \\nthe cheeks had the warmth of life through a ll their pallor. The lips were as red \\nas ever. But there was no sign of moveme nt, no pulse, no breath, no beating of \\nthe heart.  \\nI bent over him, and tried to find any si gn of life, but in vain. He could not \\nhave lain there long, for the earthy sm ell would have passed away in a few \\nhours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I \\nthought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the \\ndead eyes, and in them d ead though they were, such  a look of hate, though \\nunconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count\\'s room by the window , crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my \\nroom, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think.  \\n29 June.--Today is the date of my last  letter, and the Count has taken steps \\nto prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same \\nwindow, and in my clothes. As he went d own the wall, lizard fashion, I wished \\nI had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him. But I fear that no \\nweapon wrought along by man\\'s hand wou ld have any effect on him. I dared \\nnot wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to \\nthe library, and read there till I fell asleep.  \\nI was awakened by the Cou nt, who looked at me as grimly as a man could \\nlook as he said, \"Tomorrow, my frie nd, we must part. You return to your \\nbeautiful England, I to some work whic h may have such an end that we may \\nnever meet. Your letter home has been despatched. Tomorrow I shall not be \\nhere, but all shall be ready for your j ourney. In the morning come the Szgany, \\nwho have some labours of their own here , and also come some Slovaks. When \\nthey have gone, my carriage shall come  for you, and shall bear you to the \\nBorgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes \\nthat I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.\"  \\nI suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems \\nlike a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so \\nI asked him point-blank, \"W hy may I not go tonight?\"  \\n\"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\"  \\n\"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\"  He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabo lical smile that I knew there was \\nsome trick behind his smoothness. He said, \"And your baggage?\"  \\n\"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\"  \\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub \\nmy eyes, it seemed so real, \"You Englis h have a saying which is close to my \\nheart, for its spirit is that which rule s our boyars, \\'Welcome the coming, speed \\nthe parting guest.\\' Come with me, my dear  young friend. Not an hour shall you \\nwait in my house against your  will, though sad am I at  your going, and that you \\nso suddenly desire it. Come!\" With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, \\npreceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly  he stopped. \"Hark!\"  \\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the \\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra \\nseems to leap under the baton of the co nductor. After a pause of a moment, he \\nproceeded, in his stately way, to the do or, drew back the ponderous bolts, \\nunhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.  \\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I \\nlooked all round, b ut could see no key of any kind.  \\nAs the door began to open, the howl ing of the wolves without grew louder \\nand angrier. Their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as \\nthey leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew than that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.  With such allies as these at his \\ncommand, I could do nothing.  \\nBut still the door cont inued slowly to open, and only the Count\\'s body \\nstood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and \\nmeans of my doom. I was to be given to th e wolves, and at my own instigation. \\nThere was a diabolical wickedness in th e idea great enough fo r the Count, and \\nas the last chance I cried out, \"Shut the door! I shall wait till morning.\" And I \\ncovered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.  \\nWith one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and \\nthe great bolts clanged and echoed through  the hall as they shot back into their \\nplaces.  \\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to \\nmy own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might \\nbe proud of.  \\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a \\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly  and listened. Unless my ears deceived \\nme, I heard the voice of the Count.  \\n\"Back! Back to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have \\npatience! Tonight is mine. Tomorrow night is yours!\"  \\nThere was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the \\ndoor, and saw without the three terrible wom en licking their lips. As I appeared, \\nthey all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.  \\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near \\nthe end? Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!  \\n30 June.--These may be the last words I ever write in this diary. I slept till \\njust before the dawn, and when I wo ke threw myself on my knees, for I \\ndetermined that if Death came he should find me ready.  \\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had \\ncome. Then came the welcome cockcrow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad \\nheart, I opened the door and ran down th e hall. I had seen that the door was \\nunlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with \\neagerness, I unhooked the chains a nd threw back the massive bolts.  \\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled and pulled at the \\ndoor, and shook it till, massive as it was,  it rattled in its casement. I could see \\nthe bolt shot.

It is like \\nwhispering to one\\'s self a nd listening at the same time. And there is also \\nsomething about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I \\nam unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan . I had not heard from Jonathan for \\nsome time, and was very concerned, b ut yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is \\nalways so kind, sent me a letter from him. I had written asking him if he had \\nheard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated \\nfrom Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home . That is not like \\nJonathan. I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy.  \\nThen, too, Lucy, although she is so we ll, has lately taken to her old habit \\nof walking in her sleep. Her mother ha s spoken to me about it, and we have \\ndecided that I am to lock the doo r of our room every night.  \\nMrs. Westenra has got an idea that sl eep-walkers always go out on roofs of \\nhouses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall \\nover with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place.  \\nPoor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her \\nhusband, Lucy\\'s father, had the same ha bit, that he would get up in the night \\nand dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped.  \\nLucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her \\ndresses and how her house is to be arra nged. I sympathise with her, for I do the \\nsame, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have \\nto try to make both ends meet.  Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord \\nGodalming, is coming up here very shortly, as soon as he can leave town, for \\nhis father is not very well, and I think dear  Lucy is counting the moments till he \\ncomes.  \\nShe wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him \\nthe beauty of Whitby. I dare say it is the waiting whic h disturbs her. She will be \\nall right when he arrives.  \\n27 July.--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him, \\nthough why I should I do not know, but I do wish that he would write, if it were \\nonly a single line.  \\nLucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving \\nabout the room. Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold. But \\nstill, the anxiety and the pe rpetually being awakened is beginning to tell on me, \\nand I am getting nervous and wakeful my self. Thank God, Lucy\\'s health keeps \\nup. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly calle d to Ring to see his father, who has \\nbeen taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postpon ement of seeing him, but it \\ndoes not touch her looks. She is a trifle  stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely \\nrose-pink. She has lost the anemic look wh ich she had. I pray it will all last.  \\n3 August.--Another week go ne by, and no news from  Jonathan, not even to \\nMr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely \\nwould have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, a nd yet it is his writing. There is no \\nmistake of that.  \\nLucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd \\nconcentration about her w hich I do not understand, ev en in her sleep she seems \\nto be watching me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the \\nroom searching for the key.  \\n6 August.--Another three days, and no  news. This suspense is getting \\ndreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier. But no one has heard a word of Jonathan si nce that last letter. I must only pray \\nto God for patience.  \\nLucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was \\nvery threatening, and the fishermen say tha t we are in for a storm. I must try to \\nwatch it and learn the weather signs.  \\nToday is a gray day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high \\nover Kettleness. Everything is gray ex cept the green grass, which seems like \\nemerald amongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds, tinged with the sunburst at \\nthe far edge, hang over the gray sea, into  which the sandpoints stretch like gray \\nfigures. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, \\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a gray mist. All vastness, the clouds are piled up like giant  rocks, and there is a \\'brool\\' over the \\nsea that sounds like some passage of d oom. Dark figures are on the beach here \\nand there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem \\'men like trees walking\\'. The fishing boats are racing fo r home, and rise a nd dip in the ground \\nswell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old \\nMr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his \\nhat, that he wants to talk.  \\nI have been quite touched by the change  in the poor old man. When he sat \\ndown beside me, he said in a very gentle  way, \"I want to say something to you, \\nmiss.\"  \\nI could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine \\nand asked him to speak fully.  \\nSo he said, leaving his hand in mine, \"I\\'m afraid, my deary, that I must \\nhave shocked you by all the wicked things I\\'ve been sayin\\' about the dead, and \\nsuch like, for weeks past, but I didn\\'t mean them, and I want ye to remember \\nthat when I\\'m gone.

SEWARD\\'S DIARY  20 September.--Only resoluti on and habit can let me make an entry tonight. \\nI am too miserable, too low spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, \\nincluding life itself, that I would not care if  I heard this moment the flapping of \\nthe wings of the angel of death. And he  has been flapping those grim wings to \\nsome purpose of late, Lucy\\'s mother a nd Arthur\\'s father, and now Let me get \\non with my work.  \\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to \\ngo to rest also, but he refused at firs t. It was only when I told him that we \\nshould want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.  \\nVan Helsing was very kind to him. \"C ome, my child,\" he said. \"Come with \\nme. You are sick and weak , and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, \\nas well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone, for \\nto be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing room, where \\nthere is a big fire, and there are two sofa s. You shall lie on one, and I on the \\nother, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other,  even though we do not \\nspeak, and even if we sleep.\"  \\nArthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy\\'s face, \\nwhich lay in her pillow, almo st whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked around the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the \\nProfessor had carried out in this room, as  in the other, his purpose of using the \\ngarlic. The whole of the window sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy\\'s neck, \\nover the silk handkerchief which Van Hels ing made her keep on, was a rough \\nchaplet of the same odorous flowers.  \\nLucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, \\nfor the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, \\nseemed longer and sharper than they had b een in the morning. In particular, by \\nsome trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest.  \\nI sat down beside her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same \\nmoment there came a sort of dull flappi ng or buffeting at the window. I went \\nover to it softly, and peeped out by the co rner of the blind. There was a full \\nmoonlight, and I could see that the no ise was made by a great bat, which \\nwheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light, a lthough so dim, and every \\nnow and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, \\nI found that Lucy had move d slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers \\nfrom her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.  \\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. \\nShe took but a little, and that languidly. There did n ot seem to be with her now \\nthe unconscious struggle for life and st rength that had hitherto so marked her \\nillness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she \\npressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she \\ngot into that lethargic stat e, with the stertorous br eathing, she put the flowers \\nfrom her, but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mist ake about this, for in the long hours that followed, \\nshe had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many \\ntimes.  \\nAt six o\\'clock Van Helsing came to reli eve me. Arthur had then fallen into \\na doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy\\'s face I could \\nhear the hissing indraw of breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper. \"Draw \\nup the blind. I want ligh t!\" Then he bent down, a nd, with his face almost \\ntouching Lucy\\'s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the \\nsilk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back and I could hear his ejaculation, \"Mein Gott!\" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and \\nlooked, too, and as I noticed some qu eer chill came over me. The wounds on \\nthe throat had absolutely disappeared.  For fully five minutes Van Helsing stoo d looking at her, with his face at its \\nsternest. Then he turned to me and said  calmly, \"She is dying. It will not be \\nlong now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or \\nin her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last. He trusts \\nus, and we have promised him.\"  \\nI went to the dining room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but \\nwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in th rough the edges of the shutters he \\nthought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still \\nasleep, but told him as gently as I could th at both Van Helsing and I feared that \\nthe end was near. He covered his face w ith his hands, and slid down on his \\nknees by the sofa, where he remained, pe rhaps a minute, with his head buried, \\npraying, whilst his shou lders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and \\nraised him up. \"Come,\" I said, \"my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude. It will be best and easiest for her.\"  \\nWhen we came into Lucy\\'s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with \\nhis usual forethought, been putting ma tters straight and making everything look \\nas pleasing as possible.

I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that \\nI know, I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in \\nhis design in getting to Lond on, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and \\nhow? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is \\nanything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it over. Mina is dressing, \\nand I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over.   \\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he \\nwas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face \\nround to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny,  \\n\"But Madam Mina told me you were ill,  that you had had a shock.\"  \\nIt was so funny to hear my wife called \\'Madam Mina\\' by this kindly, \\nstrong-faced old man. I smiled, and said, \"I was ill, I have had a shock, but you \\nhave cured me already.\"  \\n\"And how?\"  \\n\"By your letter to Mina last  night. I was in doubt, and then everything took \\na hue of unreality, and I d id not know what to trust, even the evidence of my \\nown senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do, and so had \\nonly to keep on working in what had hith erto been the groove of my life. The \\ngroove ceased to avail me, and I mist rusted myself. Doc tor, you don\\'t know \\nwhat it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don\\'t, you couldn\\'t with \\neyebrows like yours.\"  \\nHe seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, \"So! You are a physiognomist. \\nI learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to \\nbreakfast, and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are \\nblessed in your wife.\"  \\nI would listen to him go on praising M ina for a day, so I simply nodded \\nand stood silent.  \\n\"She is one of God\\'s women, fash ioned by His own hand to show us men \\nand other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light \\ncan be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist, and that, let \\nme tell you, is much in this age, so sc eptical and selfish. And you, sir I have \\nread all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I \\nknow you since some days from the know ing of others, but I have seen your \\ntrue self since last night.  You will give me your hand,  will you not? And let us \\nbe friends for all our lives.\"  \\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite \\nchoky.  \"And now,\" he said, \"may I ask you for some more help? I have a great \\ntask to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here. Can you \\ntell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more \\nhelp, and of a different kind, but at first this will do.\"  \\n\"Look here, Sir,\" I said, \"does what you have to do concern the Count?\"  \\n\"It does,\" he said solemnly.  \\n\"Then I am with you heart and soul. As  you go by the 10:30 train, you will \\nnot have time to read them, but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take \\nthem with you and read them in the train.\"  \\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said, \\n\"Perhaps you will come to town if I send for you, and take Madam Mina too.\"  \\n\"We shall both come when  you will,\" I said.  \\nI had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous \\nnight, and while we were talking at th e carriage window, waiting for the train \\nto start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to catch \\nsomething in one of them, \"The Westm inster Gazette\", I knew it by the colour, \\nand he grew quite white. He read some thing intently, groa ning to himself, \\n\"Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! So soon!\" I do not think he remembered me \\nat the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This \\nrecalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the wi ndow and waved his hand, \\ncalling out, \"Love to Madam Mina. I sh all write so soon as ever I can.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I \\nsaid \"Finis,\" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the \\nrecord. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield \\nhad become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead \\nwith his fly business, and he  had just started in the spider line also, so he had \\nnot been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, \\nand from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is \\nwith him, and that is much of a help, fo r he himself is a bubbling well of good \\nspirits. Quincey wrote me a line too,  and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as to them all my mind \\nis at rest. As for myself, I was settli ng down to my work w ith the enthusiasm \\nwhich I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound \\nwhich poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.  \\nEverything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be the end God only \\nknows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only \\nlet out enough at a time to whet curios ity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and \\nstayed there all night. Today he came back, and almost bounded into the room \\nat about half-past five o\\'clock, and th rust last night\\'s \"Westminster Gazette\" \\ninto my hand.  \\n\"What do you think of that?\" he aske d as he stood back and folded his \\narms.  \\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant, but he \\ntook it from me and pointed out a pa ragraph about children being decoyed \\naway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, \\nand I looked up.  \\n\"Well?\" he said.  \\n\"It is like poor Lucy\\'s.\"  \"And what do you make of it?\"  \\n\"Simply that there is some cause in co mmon. Whatever it was that injured \\nher has injured them.\" I did not quite understand his answer.  \\n\"That is true indirectly, but not directly.\"  \"How do you mean, Professor?\" I asked. I was a little inclined to take his \\nseriousness lightly, for, af ter all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, \\nharrowing, anxiety does help to restore on e\\'s spirits, but when I'),\n",

No. It is wo rse, far, far worse.\"  \\n\"In God\\'s name, Professor Van Helsin g, what do you mean?\" I cried.  \\nHe threw himself with a despairing ge sture into a chair, and placed his \\nelbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke.  \\n\"They were made by Miss Lucy!\"  \\nCHAPTER 15  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--cont.  \\nFor a while sheer anger m\\nastered me. It was as if he had during her life \\nstruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as  I said to him, \"Dr. \\nVan Helsing, are you mad?\"  He raised his head and looked at me , and somehow the tenderness of his \\nface calmed me at once. \"Would I were!\" he said. \"Madness were easy to bear \\ncompared with truth like th is. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far \\nround, why take so long to tell so sim ple a thing? Was it beca use I hate you and \\nhave hated you all my life? Was it be cause I wished to give you pain? Was it \\nthat I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and \\nfrom a fearful death? Ah no!\"  \\n\"Forgive me,\" said I.  \\nHe went on, \"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the \\nbreaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I \\ndo not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the \\'no\\' \\nof it. It is more hard still to accept so sa d a concrete truth, and of such a one as \\nMiss Lucy. Tonight I go to prove it.  Dare you come with me?\"  \\nThis staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth, Byron \\nexcepted from the category, jealousy.  \\n\"And prove the very truth he most abhorred.\" \\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke, \"The  logic is simple, no madman\\'s logic \\nthis time, jumping from tusso ck to tussock in a misty bog.  If it not be true, then \\nproof will be relief. At worst it will no t harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the \\ndread. Yet every dread should help my caus e, for in it is some need of belief. \\nCome, I tell you what I propose. First, that we go off now and see that child in \\nthe hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child \\nis, is a friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at \\nAmsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. \\nWe shall tell him nothing, but only that  we wish to learn. And then\"  \\n\"And then?\"  \\nHe took a key from his pocket and held it up. \"And then we spend the \\nnight, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock \\nthe tomb. I had it from the coffin man to give to Arthur.\"  \\nMy heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal \\nbefore us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and \\nsaid that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing.  We found the child awake. It had ha d a sleep and taken some food, and \\naltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and \\nshowed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which \\nhad been on Lucy\\'s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher, \\nthat was all. We asked Vincent to what he  attributed them, and he replied that it \\nmust have been a bite of some animal , perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he \\nwas inclined to think it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. \"Out of so many harmless ones,\" he said, \"there \\nmay be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape, or even from the \\nZoological Gardens a young on e may have got loose, or one be bred there from \\na vampire. These things do  occur, you, know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, \\nand was, I believe, traced up in this di rection. For a week after, the children \\nwere playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in \\nthe place until this \\'bloofer lady\\' scare cam e along, since then it has been quite \\na gala time with them. Even th is poor little mite, when he woke up today, asked \\nthe nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the \\'bloofer lady\\'.\"  \\n\"I hope,\" said Van Helsing, \"that wh en you are sending the child home you \\nwill caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are \\nmost dangerous, and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I su ppose you will not let it away for some \\ndays?\"  \\n\"Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if the wound is not healed.\"  \\nOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had r eckoned on, and the \\nsun had dipped before we came out. Wh en Van Helsing saw how dark it was, \\nhe said,  \\n\"There is not hurry. It is more late  than I thought. Come, let us seek \\nsomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\"  \\nWe dined at \\'Jack Straw\\'s Castle\\' along with a little crowd of bicyclists and \\nothers who were genially noisy. About ten o\\'clock we started from the inn. It \\nwas then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radi us. The Professor had evidently noted \\nthe road we were to go, for he went on u nhesitatingly, but, as  for me, I was in \\nquite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat su rprised when we met even the patrol of \\nhorse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty, for it was \\nvery dark, and the whole place seemed so  strange to us, we found the Westenra \\ntomb. The Professor took the key, ope ned the creaky door, and standing back, \\npolitely, but quite unconsciously, m otioned me to precede him. There was a \\ndelicious irony in the offer, in the cour tliness of giving preference on such a \\nghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the \\ndoor to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring \\none. In the latter case we should have b een in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in \\nhis bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a \\nlight. The tomb in the daytime, and wh en wreathed with fresh flowers, had \\nlooked grim and gruesome enough, but now, some days afterwards, when the \\nflowers hung lank and dead,'),\n",

It is a new experience to me to \\nfind a lunatic who talk philos ophy, and reason so sound.\"  \\nI had some work to do which pressed,  so I told him that if he would go \\nalone I would be glad, as then I should  not have to keep him waiting, so I \\ncalled an attendant and ga ve him the necessary instructions. Before the \\nProfessor left the room I cautioned him  against getting an y false impression \\nfrom my patient.  \\n\"But,\" he answered, \"I want him to talk of  himself and of hi s delusion as to \\nconsuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of \\nyesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you sm ile, friend John?\"  \\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but the answer is here.\" I laid my hand on the \\ntypewritten matter. \"When our sane and learned lunatic made that very \\nstatement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous \\nwith the flies and spiders which he had eat en just before Mrs. Harker entered \\nthe room.\"  \\nVan Helsing smiled in turn. \"Good!\" he said. \"Your memory is true, friend \\nJohn. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very ob liquity of thought \\nand memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I \\nmay gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the \\nteaching of the most wise. Who knows?\"  \\nI went on with my work, and before  long was through that in hand. It \\nseemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing \\nback in the study.  \\n\"Do I interrupt?\" he asked polite ly as he stood at the door.  \\n\"Not at all,\" I answered. \"Come in. My work is finished, and I am free. I \\ncan go with you now, if you like.\"  \\n\"It is needless, I have seen him!\"  \\n\"Well?\"  \\n\"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short. \\nWhen I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him as \\ncheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He \\nmade no reply whatever. \\'Don\\'t you know  me?\\' I asked. His answer was not \\nreassuring: \\'I know you well  enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish \\nyou would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn \\nall thick-headed Dutchmen!\\' Not a wo rd more would he say, but sat in his \\nimplacable sullenness as in different to me as though I had not been in the room \\nat all. Thus departed for this time my  chance of much learning from this so \\nclever lunatic, so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Frie nd John, it does rejoice me unspeakable \\nthat she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things. \\nThough we shall much miss her help, it is better so.\"  \\n\"I agree with you with all my heart,\" I answered earnestly, for I did not \\nwant him to weaken in this matter. \"Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight \\nplaces in our time, but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in \\ntouch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her.\"  \\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer w ith Mrs. Harker and Harker, Quincey \\nand Art are all out following up the clues as  to the earth boxes. I shall finish my \\nround of work and we shall meet tonight.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n1 October.--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am today, after \\nJonathan\\'s full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid \\ncertain matters, and those the most vital of  all. This morning I slept late after \\nthe fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonath an was late too, he was the earlier. \\nHe spoke to me before he went out, ne ver more sweetly or tenderly, but he \\nnever mentioned a word of what had happ ened in the visit to the Count\\'s house. \\nAnd yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I \\nsuppose it must have distressed him even  more than it did me. They all agreed \\nthat it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I \\nacquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am crying \\nlike a silly fool, when I know it comes from my husband\\'s great love and from \\nthe good, good wishes of those other strong men.  That has done me good. Well, some da y Jonathan will tell me all. And lest \\nit should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from \\nhim, I still keep my journal as usual. Then  if he has feared of my trust I shall \\nshow it to him, with every thought of my heart put do wn for his dear eyes to \\nread. I feel strangely sad and low-spirited today. I suppose it is the reaction \\nfrom the terrible excitement.  \\nLast night I went to bed when the me n had gone, simply because they told \\nme to. I didn\\'t feel sleepy, and I did f eel full of devouring anxiety. I kept \\nthinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in \\nLondon, and it all seems like a horribl e tragedy, with fate pressing on \\nrelentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter \\nhow right it may be, to bring on the very  thing which is most to be deplored. If \\nI hadn\\'t gone to Whitby, pe rhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. She \\nhadn\\'t taken to visiting the churchyard ti ll I came, and if she hadn\\'t come there \\nin the day time with me she wouldn\\'t have walked in her sleep. And if she \\nhadn\\'t gone there at night and asleep, th at monster couldn\\'t have destroyed her \\nas he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder \\nwhat has come over me today. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one mornin g I, who never cried on my own \\naccount, and whom he has never caused to  shed a tear, the dear fellow would \\nfret his heart out. I shal l put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall \\nnever see it. I suppose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to \\nlearn  \\nI can\\'t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the \\nsudden barking of the dogs and a lot of  queer sounds, like praying on a very \\ntumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield\\'s room, which is somewhere under this. \\nAnd then there was silence over everything , silence so profound that it startled \\nme, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the \\nblack shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of \\ntheir own. Not a thing seemed to be stir ring, but all to be grim and fixed as \\ndeath or fate, so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost \\nimperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a \\nsentience and a vitality of its own. I thi nk that the digress ion of my thoughts \\nmust have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy \\ncreeping over me. I lay a while, but coul d not quite sleep, so I got out and \\nlooked out of the window again. The mi st was spreading, and was now close up \\nto the house, so that I cou ld see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were \\nstealing up to the windows. The poor ma n was more loud than ever, and though \\nI could not distinguish a word he said, I could in so me'),\n",

If you will let me have his \\nlordship\\'s address I will cons ult the House on the subject , and will, in any case, \\ncommunicate with his lordship by tonight\\'s post. It will be a pleasure if we can \\nso far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his \\nlordship.\"  \\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, \\ngave the address at Dr. Seward\\'s and came away. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and came \\ndown to Purfleet by the next train.  \\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she \\nmade a gallant effort to be bright and ch eerful. It wrung my heart to think that I \\nhad had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquiet ude. Thank God, \\nthis will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the \\nsting of our not show ing our confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the \\nwise resolution of keepi ng her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more \\nreconciled, or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for \\nwhen any accidental allusion is made sh e actually shudders. I am glad we made \\nour resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our  growing knowledge \\nwould be torture to her.  \\nI could not tell the others of the day\\'s discovery till we were alone, so after \\ndinner, followed by a little music to save  appearances even amongst ourselves, \\nI took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more \\naffectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me, but there was much to be talked of a nd I came away. Thank God, the ceasing of \\ntelling things has made no difference between us.  \\nWhen I came down again I found the o thers all gathered round the fire in \\nthe study. In the train I ha d written my diary so far, and simply read it off to \\nthem as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information.  \\nWhen I had finished Van Helsing said, \"This has been a great day\\'s work, \\nfriend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the tr ack of the missing boxes. If we find \\nthem all in that house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some \\nmissing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, \\nand hunt the wretch to his real death.\"  \\nWe all sat silent awhile and all at  once Mr. Morris spoke, \"Say! How are \\nwe going to get into that house?\"  \\n\"We got into the other,\" answered Lord Godalming quickly.  \\n\"But, Art, this is different. We broke  house at Carfax, but we had night and \\na walled park to protect us. It will  be a mighty differe nt thing to commit \\nburglary in Piccadilly, either  by day or night. I conf ess I don\\'t see how we are \\ngoing to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort.\"  \\nLord Godalming\\'s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the \\nroom. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us, \\n\"Quincey\\'s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious. We got off \\nonce all right, but we have now a rare job on hand. Unless we can find the \\nCount\\'s key basket.\"  \\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least \\nadvisable to wait till Lord Godalming shou ld hear from Mitchell\\'s, we decided \\nnot to take any active step before breakfa st time. For a good while we sat and \\nsmoked, discussing the matter in its va rious lights and bearings. I took the \\nopportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and \\nshall go to bed  \\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular.

SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n1 October.--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so \\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean \\nsomething more than his own well-being,  they form a more than interesting \\nstudy. This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, \\nhis manner was that of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact, \\ncommanding destiny, subjectively. He did not really care for an y of the things \\nof mere earth, he was in the clouds an d looked down on all the weaknesses and \\nwants of us poor mortals.  \\nI thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked \\nhim, \"What about the flies these times?\"  \\nHe smiled on me in quite a superior so rt of way, such a smile as would \\nhave become the face of Malv olio, as he answered me, \"The fly, my dear sir, \\nhas one striking feature. It\\'s wings are typical of the aerial powers of the \\npsychic faculties. The ancients did we ll when they typified the soul as a \\nbutterfly!\"  \\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logica lly, so I said quickly, \\n\"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\"  \\nHis madness foiled his reason, and a pu zzled look spread over his face as, \\nshaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him.  \\nHe said, \"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\" Here he \\nbrightened up. \"I am pretty indifferent about  it at present. Life is all right. I \\nhave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study \\nzoophagy!\"  \\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on. \"Then you command life. You \\nare a god, I suppose?\"  \\nHe smiled with an ineffably benign superi ority. \"Oh no! Far be it from me \\nto arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His \\nespecially spiritual doings. If  I may state my intellectual  position I am, so far as \\nconcerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the po sition which Enoch \\noccupied spiritually!\"  This was a poser to me. I could no t at the moment recall Enoch\\'s \\nappositeness, so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I \\nwas lowering myself in the eyes of  the lunatic. \"And why with Enoch?\"  \\n\"Because he walked with God.\"  \\nI could not see the analogy,  but did not like to admit it, so I harked back to \\nwhat he had denied. \"So you don\\'t car e about life and you don\\'t want souls. \\nWhy not?\" I put my questi on quickly and somewhat st ernly, on purpose to \\ndisconcert him.  \\nThe effort succeeded, for an instant he  unconsciously relapsed into his old \\nservile manner, bent low before me, and ac tually fawned upon me  as he replied. \\n\"I don\\'t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don\\'t. I couldn\\'t use them if I had \\nthem. They would be no manner of use to me.

But I was as sane then, \\nexcept in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me, it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realized where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\"  \\nAs he spoke, Van Helsing\\'s eyes ne ver blinked, but his hand came out and \\nmet mine and gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself. He nodded \\nslightly and said, \"Go on,\" in a low voice.  \\nRenfield proceeded. \"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen \\nhim often before, but he was solid then, n ot a ghost, and his eyes were fierce \\nlike a man\\'s when angry. He was laughi ng with his red mouth,  the sharp white \\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned  to look back over the belt of trees, \\nto where the dogs were bark ing. I wouldn\\'t ask him to co me in at first, though I \\nknew he wanted to, just as he had wante d all along. Then he began promising \\nme things, not in words but by doing them.\"  \\nHe was interrupted by a word from the Professor, \"How?\"  \"By making them happen. Just as he used  to send in the flies when the sun \\nwas shining. Great big fat ones with stee l and sapphire on their wings. And big \\nmoths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones  on their backs.\"  \\nVan Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously, \"The \\nAcherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, wh at you call the \\'Death\\'s-head Moth\\'?\"  \\nThe patient went on withou t stopping, \"Then he be gan to whisper. \\'Rats, \\nrats, rats! Hundreds, thous ands, millions of them, and every one a life. And \\ndogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! All red blood, with y ears of life in it, \\nand not merely buzzing flies!\\' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he \\ncould do. Then the dogs how led, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He \\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, \\nand seemed to call out with out using any words. A dark  mass spread over the \\ngrass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire. An d then He moved the mist \\nto the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their \\neyes blazing red, like His only smalle r. He held up his hand, and they all \\nstopped, and I thought he seemed to be saying, \\'All these live s will I give you, \\nay, and many more and greater, through  countless ages, if  you will fall down \\nand worship me!\\' And then a red cloud, l ike the colour of blood, seemed to \\nclose over my eyes, and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself \\nopening the sash and saying to Him, \\'Come in, Lord and Master!\\' The rats were \\nall gone, but He slid into the room thr ough the sash, though it was only open an \\ninch wide, just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack \\nand has stood before me in all her size and splendour.\"  \\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and \\nhe continued, but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the \\ninterval for his story was further advan ced. I was about to call him back to the \\npoint, but Van Helsing whispered to me, \"L et him go on. Do not interrupt him. \\nHe cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the \\nthread of his thought.\"  \\nHe proceeded, \"All day I waited to h ear from him, but he did not send me \\nanything, not even a blowfly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he did slide in through the window, though it was shut, and did \\nnot even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face \\nlooked out of the mist with his red eyes  gleaming, and he went on as though he \\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn\\'t even smell the same as he went by me. I couldn\\'t hold him. I tho ught that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had \\ncome into the room.\"  The two men sitting on the  bed stood up and came over, standing behind \\nhim so that he could not see them, but wher e they could hear better. They were \\nboth silent, but the Professor started a nd quivered. His face, however, grew \\ngrimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing, \"When Mrs. \\nHarker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\\'t the same. It was like tea \\nafter the teapot has been watered.\" Here  we all moved, but no one said a word.  \\nHe went on, \"I didn\\'t know that she was here till she spoke, and she didn\\'t \\nlook the same. I don\\'t care for the pale peo ple. I like them with lots of blood in \\nthem, and hers all seemed to have run out. I didn\\'t think of it at the time, but \\nwhen she went away I bega n to think, and it made me mad to know that He had \\nbeen taking the life out of her.\" I could f eel that the rest quivered, as I did; but \\nwe remained otherwise still. \"So when  He came tonight I was ready for Him. I \\nsaw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have \\nunnatural strength. And as I knew I was a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to \\nstruggle with me. I held tight, and I thought I was going to win, for I didn\\'t \\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, \\nand my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and when I tried to \\ncling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud \\nbefore me, and a noise like thunder, a nd the mist seemed to steal away under \\nthe door.\"  \\nHis voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous. Van \\nHelsing stood up instinctively.  \\n\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose. \\nIt may not be too late. Let us be armed,  the same as we were the other night, \\nbut lose no time, there is no t an instant to spare.\"  \\nThere was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words, we \\nshared them in common. We all hurried  and took from our rooms the same \\nthings that we had when we entered the Count\\'s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he  pointed to them significantly as he said, \\n\"They never leave me, and they shall not t ill this unhappy business is over. Be \\nwise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with Alas! Alas! \\nThat dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped, his voice was breaking, \\nand I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.  \\nOutside the Harkers\\' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the \\nlatter said, \"Should we disturb her?\"  \"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall break \\nit in.\"  \\n\"May it not frighten her terribly? It is  unusual to break into a lady\\'s room!\"  \\nVan Helsing'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=', in fine, if he escape n ot on shore tonight, or before dawn, there \\nwill be the whole day lost to him. We ma y then arrive in time. For if he escape \\nnot at night we shall come on him in da ytime, boxed up and at our mercy. For \\nhe dare not be his true self, awake a nd visible, lest he be discovered.\"  \\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn, at \\nwhich time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.  \\nEarly this morning we listened, with brea thless anxiety, for her response in \\nher trance. The hypnotic stage was ev en longer in coming than before, and \\nwhen it came the time remaining until full  sunrise was so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw hi s whole soul into the effort. At last, \\nin obedience to his will she made reply.  \\n\"All is dark. I hear lapping water, le vel with me, and some creaking as of \\nwood on wood.\" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till tonight.  \\nAnd so it is that we are travel ling towards Galatz in an agony of \\nexpectation. We are due to arrive be tween two and three in the morning. But \\nalready, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till \\nwell after sunup. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. \\nHarker! Either or both may possibly throw  more light on what is happening.  \\nLater.--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when \\nthere was no distraction. For had it occurr ed whilst we were at a station, we \\nmight not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded \\nto the hypnotic influence even less read ily than this morning. I am in fear that \\nher power of reading the Count\\'s sensat ions may die away, just when we want \\nit most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has c onfined herself to the simplest of facts. \\nIf this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count\\'s power \\nover her would die away equally with her power of know ledge it would be a \\nhappy thought. But I am afra id that it may not be so.  \\nWhen she did speak, her words were enigmatical, \"Something is going out. \\nI can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I ca n hear, far off, confused sounds, as of \\nmen talking in strange tongues, fierce falling water, and the howling of \\nwolves.\" She stopped and a shudder ran th rough her, increasi ng in intensity for \\na few seconds, till at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, \\neven in answer to the Professor\\'s impera tive questioning. When she woke from \\nthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid, b ut her mind was all alert. \\nShe could not remember anything, but as ked what she had said. When she was \\ntold, she pondered over it deeply  for a long time and in silence.  \\n30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to \\nwrite later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procurin g the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began \\nhis passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a s till greater difficulty, only a minute \\nbefore the sun rose. The Professor lost no time in his questioning.  \\nHer answer came with equal quickness, \"All is dark. I hear water swirling \\nby, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. \\nThere is another sound, a queer one l ike\" She stopped and grew white, and \\nwhiter still.  \\n\"Go on, go on! Speak, I command you!\" said Van Helsing in an agonized \\nvoice. At the same time there was desp air in his eyes, for the risen sun was \\nreddening even Mrs. Harker\\'s  pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started \\nas she said, sweetly and seeming ly with the utmost unconcern.  \\n\"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what  you know I can\\'t? I don\\'t remember \\nanything.\" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning \\nfrom one to the other with a troubled look, \"What have I said? What have I \\ndone? I know nothin g, only that I was lying here , half asleep, and heard you \\nsay \\'go on! speak, I command you!\\' It seemed so funny to hear you order me \\nabout, as if I were a bad child!\"  \\n\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, sadly, \"it is proof, if proof be needed, of how \\nI love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than \\never, can seem so strange because it is  to order her whom I am proud to obey!\"  \\nThe whistles are sounding.

They \\nwere more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the Czarina \\nCatherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbor. There we saw the \\nCaptain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his \\nlife he had never had so favourable a run.  \\n\"Man!\" he said, \"but it made us afeard,  for we expect it  that we should \\nhave to pay for it wi\\' some rare piece o\\' ill luck, so as to keep up the average. \\nIt\\'s no canny to run frae London to the Bl ack Sea wi\\' a wind ahint ye, as though \\nthe Deil himself were blawin\\' on yer sail for his ain purpose.

The snow brings \\nthem down from the mountains, and there ar e dangers to all of us, and from all \\nsides. The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off. We ride to death of \\nsome one. God alone knows who, or wher e, or what, or when, or how it may \\nbe  \\nDR. VAN HELSING'S MEMORANDUM  5 November, afternoon.--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at \\nall events, though the proving it has been  dreadful. When I left Madam Mina \\nsleeping within the Holy circle, I took  my way to the castle. The blacksmith \\nhammer which I took in the carriage from  Veresti was useful, though the doors \\nwere all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill intent or ill chance \\nshould close them, so that being ente red I might not get out.  Jonathan's bitter \\nexperience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old \\nchapel, for I knew that here my work lay.  The air was oppressive. It seemed as \\nif there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard af ar off the howl of wolves. Then I \\nbethought me of my dear Madam M ina, and I was in terrible plight. The \\ndilemma had me between his horns.  \\nHer, I had not dare to take into this pla ce, but left safe from the Vampire in \\nthat Holy circle. And yet even there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God's will. \\nAt any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had \\nit but been for myself the choice had b een easy, the maw of the wolf were \\nbetter to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.  \\nI knew that there were at least three grav es to find, graves that are inhabit. \\nSo I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that  in the old time, when such things were, many a \\nman who set forth to do such a task as m ine, found at the last his heart fail him, \\nand then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Undead have hypnotize him. And he remain on \\nand on, till sunset come, and the Vam pire sleep be over. Then the beautiful \\neyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the volupt uous mouth present \\nto a kiss, and the man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the \\nVampire fold. One more to swell the grim  and grisly ranks of the Undead!  \\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence \\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with \\nthe dust of centuries, though there be tha t horrid odour such as the lairs of the \\nCount have had. Yes, I was moved. I,  Van Helsing, with all my purpose and \\nwith my motive for hate. I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to \\nparalyze my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need \\nof natural sleep, and the strange oppr ession of the air were beginning to \\novercome me. Certain it was that I was la psing into sleep, the open eyed sleep \\nof one who yields to a sweet fascinatio n, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the \\nsound of a clarion. For it was the voice of  my dear Madam Mina that I heard.  \\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching \\naway tomb tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to \\nlook on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall. \\nBut I go on searching until, pr esently, I find in a high gr eat tomb as if made to \\none much beloved that other fair sist er which, like Jonathan I had seen to \\ngather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exqu isitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in \\nme, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul wail of my dear \\nMadam Mina had not died out of my ear s. And, before the spell could be \\nwrought further upon me, I had nerved myse lf to my wild work. By this time I \\nhad searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell. And as there had been only three of these Undead phantoms around us in  the night, I took it that \\nthere were no more of active Undead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest. Huge it was, a nd nobly proportioned. On it was but one \\nword.  \\nDRACULA \\nThis then was the Undead  home of the King Vampire, to whom so many \\nmore were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew. \\nBefore I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful \\nwork, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the  Wafer, and so banished him from it, \\nUndead, for ever.  \\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it had \\nbeen easy, comparative. But three! To  begin twice more after I had been \\nthrough a deed of horror. For it was te rrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what \\nwould it not be with these strange one s who had survived through centuries, \\nand who had been strengthened by the pass ing of the years. Wh o would, if they \\ncould, have fought for their foul lives  \\nOh, my friend John, but it was butch er work. Had I not been nerved by \\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I \\ncould not have gone on.

      "The larger piece of text encapsulates the complex and suspenseful narrative of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula,\" weaving together various characters' perspectives and experiences as they grapple with the terrifying reality of Count Dracula's vampirism and his sinister plans. Initially introduced through a conversation between the narrator and Count Dracula, the story unfolds with the Count's relocation to England, utilizing an estate called Carfax as his base, which sets the stage for the ensuing horror. The narrative further develops with the discovery of Dracula's true nature, the mysterious illness afflicting Lucy Westenra, and the growing concern among the characters for their loved ones' safety, particularly Mina Harker.\n",

The group, including Jonathan Harker, Dr. Seward, and others, unite in their efforts to confront and ultimately defeat Dracula, facing numerous obstacles and dangers along the way. Their journey is marked by personal struggles, encounters with the undead, and the utilization of scientific and supernatural methods to track and combat the vampire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrative crescendos with the characters' race against time to prevent Dracula from claiming Mina completely and to destroy him before he can return to his homeland. Themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the battle between good and evil permeate the text, as the characters are pushed to their limits in their quest to save Mina and rid the world of Dracula's malevolence. The text concludes with a climactic confrontation, underscoring the courage and resolve of the characters as they strive to protect each other and overcome the darkness.\n"
