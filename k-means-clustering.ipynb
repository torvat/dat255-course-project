       "Document(page_content='DRACULA  \\nby  \\nBram Stoker  \\n1897 edition  \\nCHAPTER 1  \\nJonathan Harker\\'s Journal  \\n3 May. B\\nistritz.--Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna \\nearly next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. \\nBuda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, fr om the glimpse which I got of it from \\nthe train and the little I could walk throu gh the streets. I feared to go very far \\nfrom the station, as we had arrived late  and would start as near the correct time \\nas possible.  \\nThe impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the \\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of \\nnoble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.  We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. \\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather \\nsupper, a chicken done up some way w ith red pepper, which was very good but \\nthirsty. (Mem. get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called \\n\"paprika hendl,\" and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it \\nanywhere along the Carpathians.  \\nI found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don\\'t know \\nhow I should be able to get on without it.  \\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the \\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the \\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealin g with a nobleman \\nof that country.  \\nI find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just \\non the borders of three states, Transylva nia, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the \\nmidst of the Carpathian mountains; one of  the wildest and least known portions \\nof Europe.  \\nI was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the \\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of  this country as yet to compare with our \\nown Ordance Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by \\nCount Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my \\nnotes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.  \\nIn the population of Transylvania th ere are four disti nct nationalities: \\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the \\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and \\nNorth. I am going among the latter, who cl aim to be descended from Attila and \\nthe Huns. This may be so, for when th e Magyars conquered the country in the \\neleventh century they found the Huns settled in it.  \\nI read that every known superstition  in the world is gathered into the \\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it  were the centre of some sort of \\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay ma y be very interesting. (Mem., I must \\nask the Count all about them.)  I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all \\nsorts of queer dreams. There was a d og howling all night under my window, \\nwhich may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, \\nfor I had to drink up all the water in my  carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards \\nmorning I slept and was wakened by the c ontinuous knocking at my door, so I \\nguess I must have been sleeping soundly then.  \\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour \\nwhich they said was \"mamaliga\", and e gg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very \\nexcellent dish, which they call \"impletata\".  (Mem., get recipe for this also.)  \\nI had to hurry breakfast, for the train st arted a little before eight, or rather it \\nought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the \\ncarriage for more than an hour before we began to move.  \\nIt seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the \\ntrains. What ought they to be in China?  \\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle th rough a country which was full of \\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of \\nsteep hills such as we see in old miss a l s ;  s o m e t i m e s  w e  r a n  b y  r i v e r s  a n d  \\nstreams which seemed from the wide ston y margin on each side of them to be \\nsubject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the \\noutside edge of a river clear.  \\nAt every station there were groups of  people, sometimes crowds, and in all \\nsorts of attire. Some of them were just li ke the peasants at home or those I saw \\ncoming through France and Germany, with short jackets, and round hats, and \\nhome-made trousers; but others were very picturesque.  \\nThe women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were \\nvery clumsy about the waist. They ha d all full white sleeves of some kind or \\nother, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering \\nfrom them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under \\nthem.  \\nThe strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian \\nthan the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, \\nwhite linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all \\nstudded over with brass nails. They wore  high boots, with their trousers tucked \\ninto them, and had long black hair and he avy black moustaches. They are very \\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessi ng. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of  brigands. They are, however, I am \\ntold, very harmless and rather wa nting in natural self-assertion.  \\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when  we got to Bistritz, which is a very \\ninteresting old place. Being pr actically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads \\nfrom it into Bukovina--it has had a very  stormy existence,  and it certainly \\nshows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series  of great fires took place, which made \\nterrible havoc on five separate occasi ons. At the very beginning of the \\nseventeenth century it underwent a sieg e of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, \\nthe casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.  \\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I \\nfound, to my great delight, to be thorou ghly old-fashioned, for of course I \\nwanted to see all I could of the  ways of the country.  \\nI was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-\\nlooking elderly woman in the usual pe asant dress--white undergarment with a \\nlong double apron, front, and back, of colo ured stuff fitting al most too tight for \\nmodesty. When I came close she bowed and said, \"The Herr Englishman?\"  \\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"Jonathan Harker.\"  \\nShe smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white \\nshirtsleeves, who had f ollowed her to the door.  \\nHe went, but immediately returned with a letter:  \"My friend.--Welcome to the Carpathia ns. I am anxiously expecting you. \\nSleep well tonight. At three tomorrow the diligence will star t for Bukovina; a \\nplace on it is kept for you. At the Bo rgo Pass my carriage will await you and \\nwill bring you to me. I tr ust that your journey from  London has been a happy \\none, and that you will enjo y your stay in my bea utiful land.--Your friend, \\nDracula.\"   \\n4 May--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing \\nhim to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to \\ndetails he seemed somewhat reticent,  and pretended that he could not \\nunderstand my German.  This could not be true, because up to th en he had understood it perfectly; \\nat least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did.  \\nHe and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in \\na frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a \\nletter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, \\nand could tell me anything of his cas tle, both he and his wife crossed \\nthemselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak \\nfurther. It was so near the time of st arting that I had no time to ask anyone else, \\nfor it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.  \\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a \\nhysterical way: \"Must you go? Oh! Young Herr, must you go?\" She was in \\nsuch an excited state that sh e seemed to have lost her grip of what German she \\nknew, and mixed it all up with some other la nguage which I did not know at all. \\nI was just able to follow her by asking  many questions. When I told her that I \\nmust go at once, and that I was enga ged on important business, she asked \\nagain:  \\n\"Do you know what day it is?\" I answ ered that it was the fourth of May. \\nShe shook her head as she said again:  \\n\"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, bu t do you know what day it is?\"  \\nOn my saying that I did not understand, she went on:  \\n\"It is the eve of St. George\\'s Day. Do you not know that tonight, when the \\nclock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the worl d will have full sway? Do \\nyou know where you are going, and what you are going to?\" She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect . Finally, she went \\ndown on her knees and implored me not to  go; at least to wait a day or two \\nbefore starting.  \\nIt was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there \\nwas business to be done, and I could allow nothing to int erfere with it.  \\nI tried to raise her up, and said, as gr avely as I could, that I thanked her, \\nbut my duty was imperative, and that I must go.  \\nShe then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck \\noffered it to me.  I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been \\ntaught to regard such things as in some  measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed \\nso ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind.  \\nShe saw, I suppose, the doubt in my f ace, for she put the rosary round my \\nneck and said, \"For your mother\\'s sake,\" and went out of the room.  \\nI am writing up this part of the dia ry whilst I am waiting for the coach, \\nwhich is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck.  \\nWhether it is the old lady\\'s fear, or  the many ghostly traditions of this \\nplace, or the crucifix itself , I do not know, but I am not f eeling nearly as easy in \\nmy mind as usual.  \\nIf this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my goodbye. \\nHere comes the coach!  \\n5 May. The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed, and the sun is \\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I \\nknow not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed.  \\nI am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write \\ntill sleep comes.  \\nThere are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may \\nfancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner \\nexactly.  \\nI dined on what they called \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, \\nseasoned with red pepper, an d strung on sticks, and roasted over the fire, in \\nsimple style of the London cat\\'s meat!  \\nThe wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the \\ntongue, which is, however, not disagreeable.  \\nI had only a couple of glasses  of this, and nothing else.  \\nWhen I got on the coach, the driver ha d not taken his seat, and I saw him \\ntalking to the landlady.  They were evidently talking of me, fo r every now and then they looked at \\nme, and some of the people who were  sitting on the bench outside the door--\\ncame and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear \\na lot of words often repeated, queer word s, for there were many nationalities in \\nthe crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary  from my bag and looked \\nthem out.  \\nI must say they were not cheering to  me, for amongst them were \"Ordog\"--\\nSatan, \"Pokol\"--hell, \"stregoica\"--witch,  \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both mean \\nthe same thing, one bei ng Slovak and the other Servian for something that is \\neither werewolf or vampire. (Mem ., I must ask the Count about these \\nsuperstitions.)  \\nWhen we started, the crowd round th e inn door, which had by this time \\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two \\nfingers towards me.  \\nWith some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant. \\nHe would not answer at first, but on lear ning that I was English, he explained \\nthat it was a charm or guard against the evil eye.  \\nThis was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to \\nmeet an unknown man. But everyone seem ed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, \\nand so sympathetic that I co uld not but be  touched.  \\nI shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn yard and its \\ncrowd of picturesque figures, all crossi ng themselves, as they stood round the \\nwide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.  \\nThen our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the \\nboxseat,--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked  his big whip over his four small \\nhorses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.  \\nI soon lost sight and recollection of  ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene \\nas we drove along, although had I kn own the language, or rather languages, \\nwhich my fellow-passengers were speakin g, I might not have been able to \\nthrow them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and \\nwoods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with \\nfarmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a \\nbewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry. And as we drove \\nby I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what  they call here the \"Mittel Land\" ran \\nthe road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the \\nstraggling ends of pine woods , which here and there ran down the hillsides like \\ntongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a \\nfeverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that \\nthis road is in summertime excellent, b ut that it had not yet been put in order \\nafter the winter snows. In th is respect it is different from the general run of \\nroads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in \\ntoo good order. Of old the Ho spadars would not repair them, lest the Turk \\nshould think that they were  preparing to bring in fore ign troops, and so hasten \\nthe war which was always really at loading point.  \\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the  Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of \\nforest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpat hians themselves. Right and left of us \\nthey towered, with the afternoon sun fall ing full upon them and bringing out all \\nthe glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and po inted crags, till these were themselves \\nlost in the distance, where the snowy p eaks rose grandly. Here and there \\nseemed mighty rifts in the mountains, thr ough which, as the sun began to sink, \\nwe saw now and again the white gl eam of falling water. One of my \\ncompanions touched my arm as we swe pt round the base of a hill and opened \\nup the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on \\nour serpentine way, to be right before us.  \\n\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God\\'s seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.  \\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower \\nbehind us, the shadows of the evenin g began to creep round us. This was \\nemphasized by the fact that the snowy m ountain-top still held the sunset, and \\nseemed to glow out with a delicate cool pi nk. Here and there we passed Cszeks \\nand slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully \\nprevalent. By the roadside were ma ny crosses, and as we swept by, my \\ncompanions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or \\nwoman kneeling before a shrine, wh o did not even turn round as we \\napproached, but seemed in the self-surre nder of devotion to have neither eyes \\nnor ears for the outer world. There were  many things new to me. For instance, \\nhay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping \\nbirch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the \\nleaves.  Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasants\\'s cart--\\nwith its long, snakelike vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. \\nOn this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants, the \\nCszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured sheepskins, the \\nlatter carrying lance-fashion their long st aves, with axe at end. As the evening \\nfell it began to get very cold, and the gr owing twilight seemed to merge into \\none dark mistiness the gloom of the tree s, oak, beech, and pine, though in the \\nvalleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through \\nthe Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that \\nseemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness \\nwhich here and there bestrewed the tr ees, produced a peculiarly weird and \\nsolemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fa ncies engendered \\nearlier in the evening, when the fallin g sunset threw into strange relief the \\nghost-like clouds which amongst the  Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly \\nthrough the valleys. Sometimes the hills were  so steep that, despite our driver\\'s \\nhaste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get dow n and walk up them, \\nas we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said. \"You \\nmust not walk here. The dogs are too fierce.\" And then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry --for he looked round to catch the \\napproving smile of the rest--\"And you ma y have enough of such matters before \\nyou go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment\\'s pause to light \\nhis lamps.  \\nWhen it grew dark there seemed  to be some excitement amongst the \\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging \\nhim to further speed. He lashed the hors es unmercifully with his long whip, and \\nwith wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then \\nthrough the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as \\nthough there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew \\ngreater. The crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a \\nboat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold  on. The road grew more level, and \\nwe appeared to fly along. Then the moun tains seemed to come nearer to us on \\neach side and to frown down upon us. We were entering on the Borgo Pass. \\nOne by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon \\nme with an earnestness whic h would take no denial. These were certainly of an \\nodd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly \\nword, and a blessing, and that same strange mixture of fear-meaning \\nmovements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistri tz--the sign of the cross \\nand the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned \\nforward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting \\nwas either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one \\nwould give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for \\nsome little time. And at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the \\neastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, \\noppressive sense of thunder. It seem ed as though the mountain range had \\nseparated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I \\nwas now myself looking out for the conv eyance which was to take me to the \\nCount. Each moment I expect ed to see the glare of lamps through the blackness, \\nbut all was dark. The only light was the f lickering rays of our own lamps, in \\nwhich the steam from our hard-driven hors es rose in a white  cloud. We could \\nsee now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back w ith a sigh of gladness, which seemed to \\nmock my own disappointment. I was alread y thinking what I had best do, when \\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone, I thought it was \"An \\nhour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he spoke in German worse than \\nmy own.  \\n\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is  not expected after all. He will now \\ncome on to Bukovina, and return tomorrow or the next day, better the next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge \\nwildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of \\nscreams from the peasants and a univers al crossing of themselves, a caleche, \\nwith four horses, drove up behind us, ov ertook us, and drew up beside the \\ncoach. I could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them, that the \\nhorses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, \\nwith a long brown beard and a great black  hat, which seemed to hide his face \\nfrom us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed \\nred in the lamplight, as he turned to us.  \\nHe said to the driver, \"You are early tonight, my friend.\"  \\nThe man stammered in reply, \"The  English Herr was in a hurry.\"  \\nTo which the stranger replied, \"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to \\ngo on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend. I know too much, and \\nmy horses are swift.\"  \\nAs he spoke he smiled, and the lam plight fell on a hard-looking mouth, \\nwith very red lips and sharp-looking te eth, as white as ivory. One of my \\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger\\'s \"Lenore\".  \"Denn die Todten reiten Schnell.\" (\" For the dead travel fast.\")  \\nThe strange driver evidently heard th e words, for he looked up with a \\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting \\nout his two fingers and crossing himself . \"Give me the Herr\\'s luggage,\" said the \\ndriver, and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the \\ncaleche. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the caleche was close \\nalongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of \\nsteel. His strength must have been prodigious.  \\nWithout a word he shook his reins, the  horses turned, and we swept into \\nthe darkness of the pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and \\ncalled to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank \\ninto the darkness I felt a strange chill,  and a lonely feeling come over me. But a \\ncloak was thrown over my shoulders, an d a rug across my knees, and the driver \\nsaid in excellent German--\"The night is ch ill, mein Herr, and my master the \\nCount bade me take all care of you. Ther e is a flask of slivovitz (the plum \\nbrandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\"  \\nI did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I \\nfelt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any \\nalternative I should have taken it, in stead of prosecuting that unknown night \\njourney. The carriage went at a hard pa ce straight along, then we made a \\ncomplete turn and went along another st raight road. It seemed to me that we \\nwere simply going over and over the same  ground again, and so I took note of \\nsome salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked \\nthe driver what this all meant, but I r eally feared to do so, for I thought that, \\nplaced as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an \\nintention to delay.  \\nBy-and-by, however, as I was curiou s to know how time was passing, I \\nstruck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch. It was within a few \\nminutes of midnight. This gave me a sort  of shock, for I suppose the general \\nsuperstition about midnight was increas ed by my recent experiences. I waited \\nwith a sick feeling of suspense.  \\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road, a \\nlong, agonized wailing, as if from fear . The sound was take n up by another dog, \\nand then another and another, till, bo rne on the wind which now sighed softly \\nthrough the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the \\nnight.  \\nAt the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to \\nthem soothingly, an d they quieted down, but shive red and sweated as though \\nafter a runaway from sudden fright. Th en, far off in the distance, from the \\nmountains on each side of us began a lo uder and a sharper howling, that of \\nwolves, which affected both the horses and myself in the same way. For I was \\nminded to jump from the caleche and run,  whilst they reared  again and plunged \\nmadly, so that the driver had to use a ll his great strength to keep them from \\nbolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, \\nand the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to \\nstand before them.  \\nHe petted and soothed them, and whis pered something in their ears, as I \\nhave heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable ag ain, though they still trembled. The \\ndriver again took his seat, a nd shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This \\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly tu rned down a narrow \\nroadway which ran shar ply to the right.  \\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, w hich in places arched right over the \\nroadway till we passed as through a tu nnel. And again great frowning rocks \\nguarded us boldly on either side. Though we  were in shelter, we could hear the \\nrising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of \\nthe trees crashed together as we swept al ong. It grew colder and colder still, \\nand fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were \\ncovered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the \\ndogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the \\nwolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were c losing round on us \\nfrom every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least dis turbed. He ke pt turning his he ad to left \\nand right, but I could not see an ything through the darkness.  \\nSuddenly, away on our left I saw a fa int flickering blue flame. The driver \\nsaw it at the same moment. He at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the \\nground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as \\nthe howling of the wolves grew clos er. But while I wondered, the driver \\nsuddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed \\nour journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, \\nfor it seemed to be repeated endlessly, a nd now looking back, it is like a sort of \\nawful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver\\'s motions. He went rapidly to \\nwhere the blue flame arose, it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to \\nillumine the place around it at all, and gathering a few stones, formed them into \\nsome device.  \\nOnce there appeared a strange optical effect. When he stood between me \\nand the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the \\nsame. This startled me, but as the eff ect was only momentary, I took it that my \\neyes deceived me straining through the da rkness. Then for a time there were no \\nblue flames, and we sped onwards thro ugh the gloom, with the howling of the \\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.  \\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had \\nyet gone, and during his absence, the hor ses began to tremble worse than ever \\nand to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the \\nhowling of the wolves had ceased altoge ther. But just then the moon, sailing \\nthrough the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of  a beetling, pine-\\nclad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth \\nand lolling red tongues, w ith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a \\nhundred times more terrible in the grim  silence which held them than even \\nwhen they howled. For myself, I felt a sort  of paralysis of fear. It is only when \\na man feels himself face to face with such  horrors that he can understand their \\ntrue import.  \\nAll at once the wolves began to ho wl as though the moonlight had had \\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses  jumped about and reared, and looked \\nhelplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see. But the living \\nring of terror encompassed them on every side, and they had perforce to remain \\nwithin it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach, I shouted and beat the side of the cal eche, hoping by the noise to scare the \\nwolves from the side, so as to give hi m a chance of reaching the trap. How he \\ncame there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he \\nswept his long arms, as th ough brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the \\nwolves fell back and back further still.  Just then a heavy cloud passed across \\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.  \\nWhen I could see again the driver wa s climbing into the caleche, and the \\nwolves disappeared. This was all so stra nge and uncanny that a dreadful fear \\ncame upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now  in almost complete darkness, for the \\nrolling clouds obsc ured the moon.  \\nWe kept on ascending, w ith occasional periods of qui ck descent, but in the \\nmain always ascending. Suddenly, I beca me conscious of the fact that the \\ndriver was in the act of pul ling up the horses in the cour tyard of a vast ruined \\ncastle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken \\nbattlements showed a jagged  line against the sky.  \\nCHAPTER 2  \\nJonathan Harker\\'s Journal Continued  \\n5 May.--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I \\nm\\nust have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the \\ncourtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it \\nunder great round arches, it pe rhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not \\nyet been able to see it by daylight.  \\nWhen the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand \\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodig ious strength. His \\nhand actually seemed like a steel vice that  could have crushed mine if he had \\nchosen. Then he took my traps, and pl aced them on the ground beside me as I \\nstood close to a great door, old and stu dded with large iron nails, and set in a \\nprojecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the \\nstone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time \\nand weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the \\nreins. The horses started forward, and tr ap and all disappeared down one of the \\ndark openings.  \\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or \\nknocker there was no sign. Through the se frowning walls and dark window \\nopenings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited \\nseemed endless, and I felt doubts and f ears crowding upon me. What sort of \\nplace had I come to, and among what k ind of people? What sort of grim \\nadventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in \\nthe life of a solicitor\\'s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate \\nto a foreigner? Solicitor\\'s clerk! Mina  would not like that.  Solicitor, for just \\nbefore leaving London I go t word that my examinat ion was successful, and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see \\nif I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected \\nthat I should suddenly awake, and find  myself at home, with the dawn \\nstruggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning \\nafter a day of overwork. But my flesh an swered the pinching test, and my eyes \\nwere not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians. All I \\ncould do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of morning.  \\nJust as I had come to this conclu sion I heard a heavy step approaching \\nbehind the great door, and saw through the  chinks the gleam of a coming light. \\nThen there was the sound of rattling ch ains and the clanki ng of massive bolts \\ndrawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.  \\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shav en save for a long white moustache, \\nand clad in black from head to foot, w ithout a single speck of  colour about him \\nanywhere. He held in his hand an an tique silver lamp, in which the flame \\nburned without a chimney or globe of  any kind, throwing long quivering \\nshadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door. The old man motioned \\nme in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, sa ying in excellent English, \\nbut with a strange intonation.  \\n\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely a nd of your own free will!\" He made \\nno motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture \\nof welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that I had stepped \\nover the threshold, he moved impulsiv ely forward, and holding out his hand \\ngrasped mine with a strength which made  me wince, an effect which was not \\nlessened by the fact that it seemed cold as ice, more like the hand of a dead \\nthan a living man. Again he said,  \\n\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely. Go safely, and leave something of \\nthe happiness you bring!\" The strength of  the handshake was so much akin to \\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a \\nmoment I doubted if it were not the same  person to whom I was speaking. So \\nto make sure, I said interrogatively, \"Count Dracula?\"  \\nHe bowed in a courtly way as he replied, \"I am Dracula, and I bid you \\nwelcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in, the night air is chill, and you \\nmust need to eat and rest.\" As he was sp eaking, he put the la mp on a bracket on \\nthe wall, and stepping out, took my luggage. He had carried it in before I could forestall him. I protested, but he insisted.  \"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not available. Let \\nme see to your comfort myself.\" He in sisted on carrying my traps along the \\npassage, and then up a great winding st air, and along another great passage, on \\nwhose stone floor our steps rang heavily.  At the end of this he threw open a \\nheavy door, and I rejoiced to see with in a well-lit room in which a table was \\nspread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly \\nreplenished, flamed and flared.  \\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the \\nroom, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Pa ssing through this, \\nhe opened another door, and motioned me to  enter. It was a welcome sight. For \\nhere was a great bedroom well lighted a nd warmed with another log fire, also \\nadded to but lately, for the top logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the \\nwide chimney. The Count himself left my  luggage inside and withdrew, saying, \\nbefore he closed the door.  \\n\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your \\ntoilet. I trust you will f ind all you wish. When you are ready, come into the \\nother room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"  \\nThe light and warmth and the Count\\'s courteous welcome seemed to have \\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Ha ving then reached my normal state, I \\ndiscovered that I was half famished w ith hunger. So making a hasty toilet, I \\nwent into the other room.  \\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the \\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the st onework, made a graceful wave of his \\nhand to the table, and said,  \\n\"I pray you, be seated and sup how yo u please. You will I trust, excuse me \\nthat I do not join you, but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"  \\nI handed to him the sealed letter w hich Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me. \\nHe opened it and read it gravely. Then, with a charming smile, he handed it to \\nme to read. One passage of it, at l east, gave me a thrill of pleasure.  \\n\"I must regret that an attack of gou t, from which malady I am a constant \\nsufferer, forbids absolute ly any travelling on my part for some time to come. \\nBut I am happy to say I can send a suffici ent substitute, one in whom I have \\nevery possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy and talent in his \\nown way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He sh all be ready to attend on you when \\nyou will during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters.\"  \\nThe count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell \\nto at once on an excellent roast chicken.  This, with some cheese and a salad \\nand a bottle of old tokay, of which I ha d two glasses, was my supper. During \\nthe time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, \\nand I told him by degrees all I had experienced.  \\nBy this time I had finished my supper , and by my host\\'s desire had drawn \\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the \\nsame time excusing himself that he did no t smoke. I had now an opportunity of \\nobserving him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.  \\nHis face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high br idge of the thin \\nnose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed forehead, and hair \\ngrowing scantily round the temples bu t profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows \\nwere very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that \\nseemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under \\nthe heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp \\nwhite teeth. These protruded over the li ps, whose remarkable ruddiness showed \\nastonishing vitality in a man of his years.  For the rest, his ears were pale, and at \\nthe tops extremely pointed. The chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm \\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.  \\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the \\nfirelight, and they had seemed rather whi te and fine. But seeing them now close \\nto me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse, broad, with squat \\nfingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails \\nwere long and fine, and cut to a sharp po int. As the Count leaned over me and \\nhis hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of  nausea came over me, which, do what \\nI would, I could not conceal.  \\nThe Count, evidently notic ing it, drew back. And w ith a grim sort of smile, \\nwhich showed more than he had yet done his protruberant teeth, sat himself \\ndown again on his own side of the fireplace. We were both silent for a while, and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness over everything. But as I listened, I \\nheard as if from down below in the va lley the howling of many wolves. The \\nCount\\'s eyes gleamed, and he said.  \"Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!\" Seeing, \\nI suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added, \"Ah, sir, you \\ndwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter.\" Then he rose \\nand said.  \\n\"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, a nd tomorrow you shall \\nsleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon, so sleep well and \\ndream well!\" With a courteous bow, he op ened for me himself the door to the \\noctagonal room, and I entered my bedroom.  \\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt. I fear. I think strange things, which I \\ndare not confess to my ow n soul. God keep me, if onl y for the sake of those \\ndear to me!  \\n7 May.--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last \\ntwenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day,  and awoke of my own accord. \\nWhen I had dressed myself I went into  the room where we had supped, and \\nfound a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on \\nthe hearth. There was a card on the table, on which was written--\"I have to be \\nabsent for a while. Do not wait for me. D.\" I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. \\nWhen I had done, I looked for a bell, so th at I might let the servants know I had \\nfinished, but I could not f ind one. There are certainly odd deficiencies in the \\nhouse, considering the extraordinary ev idences of wealth which are round me. \\nThe table service is of gold, and so be autifully wrought that it must be of \\nimmense value. The curtains and upholste ry of the chairs and sofas and the \\nhangings of my bed are of the costlies t and most beautiful fabrics, and must \\nhave been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, \\nthough in excellent order. I saw some thing like them in Hampton Court, but \\nthey were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is \\nthere a mirror. There is not even a toile t glass on my table, and I had to get the \\nlittle shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair. I \\nhave not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound n ear the castle except \\nthe howling of wolves. Some time after I had finished my meal, I do not know \\nwhether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o\\'clock \\nwhen I had it, I looked about for some thing to read, for I did  not like to go \\nabout the castle until I had asked the Co unt\\'s permission. There was absolutely \\nnothing in the room, book, ne wspaper, or even writing materials, so I opened \\nanother door in the room and found a sort  of library. The door opposite mine I \\ntried, but found locked.  In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, \\nwhole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. \\nA table in the centre was littered with  English magazines and newspapers, \\nthough none of them were of very r ecent date. The books were of the most \\nvaried kind, history, geography, politics,  political economy,  botany, geology, \\nlaw, all relating to England and English  life and customs and manners. There \\nwere even such books of reference as the London Directory, the \"Red\" and \\n\"Blue\" books, Whitaker\\'s Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and it somehow \\ngladdened my heart to see it, the Law List.  \\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered. \\nHe saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night\\'s rest. \\nThen he went on.  \\n\"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that \\nwill interest you. These companions,\" and he laid his hand on some of the \\nbooks, \"have been good friends  to me, and for some year s past, ever since I had \\nthe idea of going to London,  have given me many, many hours of pleasure. \\nThrough them I have come to know your great England, and to know her is to \\nlove her. I long to go throu gh the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be \\nin the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its \\ndeath, and all that makes it what it is . But alas! As yet I only know your tongue \\nthrough books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"  \\n\"But, Count,\" I said, \"You know and speak English thoroughly!\" He \\nbowed gravely.  \\n\"I thank you, my friend, for your all to o-flattering estimate, but yet I fear \\nthat I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know the grammar \\nand the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"  \\n\"Indeed,\" I said, \"You speak excellently.\"  \\n\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know  that, did I move and speak in your \\nLondon, none there are w ho would not know me for a stranger. That is not \\nenough for me. Here I am noble. I am a Boyar. The common people know me, \\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one. Men know him \\nnot, and to know not is to car e not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that \\nno man stops if he sees me, or pauses in his speaking if he hears my words, \\'Ha, \\nha! A stranger!\\' I have been so long master  that I would be master still, or at \\nleast that none other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as \\nagent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Ex eter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here wi th me a while, so that by our talking I \\nmay learn the English into nation. And I would that you tell me when I make \\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speakin g. I am sorry that I had to be away so \\nlong today, but you will, I know forgive one who has so many important affairs \\nin hand.\"  \\nOf course I said all I could about bei ng willing, and asked if I might come \\ninto that room when I chose. He an swered, \"Yes, certainl y,\" and added.  \\n\"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are \\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that all things \\nare as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, \\nyou would perhaps better understand.\" I sa id I was sure of this, and then he \\nwent on.  \\n\"We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are \\nnot your ways, and there sh all be to you many strange things. Nay, from what \\nyou have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what \\nstrange things there may be.\"  \\nThis led to much conversation, and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, \\nif only for talking\\'s sake, I asked him ma ny questions regardin g things that had \\nalready happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he sheered off \\nthe subject, or turned the conversation  by pretending not to understand, but \\ngenerally he answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I \\nhad got somewhat bolder, I asked him of  some of the strange things of the \\npreceding night, as for inst ance, why the coachman we nt to the places where he \\nhad seen the blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly \\nbelieved that on a certain night of the ye ar, last night, in fact, when all evil \\nspirits are supposed to have unchecked  sway, a blue flame is seen over any \\nplace where treasure has been concealed.  \\n\"That treasure has been hidden,\" he went on, \"in the region through which \\nyou came last night, there can be but litt le doubt. For it was the ground fought \\nover for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is \\nhardly a foot of soil in all this region tha t has not been enriched by the blood of \\nmen, patriots or invaders. In the old days  there were stirring times, when the \\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hor des, and the patriots went out to \\nmeet them, men and women, the aged a nd the children too, and waited their \\ncoming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on \\nthem with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he \\nfound but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.\"  \"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there \\nis a sure index to it if men will but ta ke the trouble to look?\" The Count smiled, \\nand as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out \\nstrangely. He answered:  \\n\"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only \\nappear on one night, and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, \\nstir without his doors. A nd, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to \\ndo. Why, even the peasant that you te ll me of who marked the place of the \\nflame would not know where to look in da ylight even for his own work. Even \\nyou would not, I dare be  sworn, be able to find these places again?\"  \\n\"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even to \\nlook for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.  \\n\"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of  London and of the house which you \\nhave procured for me.\" With an apolo gy for my remissness, I went into my \\nown room to get the papers from my ba g. Whilst I was placing them in order I \\nheard a rattling of china and silver in th e next room, and as I passed through, \\nnoticed that the table had been cleared a nd the lamp lit, for it was by this time \\ndeep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or li brary, and I found \\nthe Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English \\nBradshaw\\'s Guide. When I came in he cl eared the books and papers from the \\ntable, and with him I went in to plans and deeds and figu res of all sorts. He was \\ninterested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and \\nits surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the \\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he ev idently at the end knew very much more \\nthan I did. When I remarked this, he answered.  \\n\"Well, but, my friend, is it not n eedful that I should ? When I go there I \\nshall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan, nay, pardon me. I fall into my country\\'s habit of putting your patronymic first, my friend Jonathan Harker \\nwill not be by my side to correct and ai d me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, \\nprobably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. \\nSo!\"  \\nWe went thoroughly into the business of  the purchase of the estate at \\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary \\npapers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he \\nbegan to ask me how I had come across so  suitable a place. I read to him the \\nnotes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here.  \"At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came acros s just such a place as seemed to be \\nrequired, and where was displayed a d ilapidated notice that the place was for \\nsale. It was surrounded by a high wall, of  ancient structure, built of heavy \\nstones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates \\nare of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.  \\n\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face, \\nas the house is four sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It \\ncontains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by th e solid stone wall \\nabove mentioned. There are many trees on  it, which make it in places gloomy, \\nand there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some \\nsprings, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house \\nis very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediaeval times, for one \\npart is of stone immensely thick, w ith only a few windows high up and heavily \\nbarred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or \\nchurch. I could not enter it,  as I had not the key of the door leading to it from \\nthe house, but I have taken with my Koda k views of it from various points. The \\nhouse had been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at \\nthe amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few \\nhouses close at hand, one being a very  large house only recently added to and \\nformed into a private lunatic asylum. It  is not, however, visible from the \\ngrounds.\"  \\nWhen I had finished, he said, \"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am \\nof an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be \\nmade habitable in a day, and after all, how few days go to make up a century. I \\nrejoice also that there is a chapel of  old times. We Transylvanian nobles love \\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety \\nnor mirth, not the bright volu ptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters \\nwhich please the young and gay. I am no longer young, and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mi rth. Moreover, the \\nwalls of my castle are broken. The sh adows are many, and the wind breathes \\ncold through the broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the \\nshadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his \\nwords and his look did not s eem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face \\nmade his smile look malignant and saturnine.  \\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me , asking me to pull my papers together. \\nHe was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around \\nme. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally to England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings \\nmarked, and on examining these I noticed th at one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated. The other two were Exeter, \\nand Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.  \\nIt was the better part of an hour when  the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he said. \\n\"Still at your books? G ood! But you must not work always. Come! I am \\ninformed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into the \\nnext room, where I found an excellent  supper ready on the table. The Count \\nagain excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home. But \\nhe sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, \\nas on the last evening, and the C ount stayed with me, chatting and asking \\nquestions on every conceiva ble subject, hour after hour . I felt that it was getting \\nvery late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet \\nmy host\\'s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday \\nhad fortified me, but I could not help ex periencing that chill which comes over \\none at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to dawn or \\nat the turn of the tide. Anyone who has wh en tired, and tied as it were to his \\npost, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of the cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through \\nthe clear morning air.  \\nCount Dracula, jumping to his feet, sa id, \"Why there is the morning again! \\nHow remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of Engla nd less interesting, so that I may not \\nforget how time flies by us,\" and with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.  \\nI went into my room and drew the curt ains, but there was little to notice. \\nMy window opened into the courtyard, al l I could see was the warm grey of \\nquickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.  \\n8 May.--I began to fear as I wrote in  this book that I was getting too \\ndiffuse. But now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is \\nsomething so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy. \\nI wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come. It may be that this strange \\nnight existence is telling on me, but would that that were all! If there were any \\none to talk to I could bear it, but there is  no one. I have only the Count to speak \\nwith, and he--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let me be \\nprosaic so far as facts can be. It will help me to bear up, and imagination must \\nnot run riot with me. If it does I am lost.  Let me say at once how I stand, or \\nseem to.  I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not \\nsleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was \\njust beginning to shave.  Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the \\nCount\\'s voice saying to me, \"Good morning. \" I started, for it amazed me that I \\nhad not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room \\nbehind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the \\nmoment. Having answered the  Count\\'s salutation, I turne d to the glass again to \\nsee how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man \\nwas close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no \\nreflection of him in the mirror! The whole  room behind me was displayed, but \\nthere was no sign of a man in it, except myself.  \\nThis was startling, and coming on the top of so many strange things, was \\nbeginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have \\nwhen the Count is near. But at the instan t I saw that the cut had bled a little, \\nand the blood was trickling ov er my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did \\nso half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, \\nhis eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fu ry, and he suddenly made a grab at \\nmy throat. I drew away an d his hand touched the string  of beads which held the \\ncrucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I \\ncould hardly believe that it was ever there.  \\n\"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous \\nthat you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on, \\n\"And this is the wretched thing that has do ne the mischief. It is a foul bauble of \\nman\\'s vanity. Away with it!\" And opening the window with one wrench of his \\nterrible hand, he flung out the glass, wh ich was shattered into a thousand pieces \\non the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It \\nis very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case \\nor the bottom of the shaving pot, which is fortunately of metal.  \\nWhen I went into the dining room, break fast was prepared, but I could not \\nfind the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted a lone. It is strange that as yet I have \\nnot seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After \\nbreakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found \\na room looking towards the South.  \\nThe view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every \\nopportunity of seeing it. Th e castle is on the very edge of a terrific precipice. A \\nstone falling from the window would fa ll a thousand feet without touching \\nanything! As far as the eye can reac h is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is  a chasm. Here and there are silver \\nthreads where the rivers wind in d eep gorges through the forests.  \\nBut I am not in heart to describe beau ty, for when I had seen the view I \\nexplored further. Doors, doors, doors everywhere, an d all locked and bolted. In \\nno place save from the windows in the cast le walls is there an available exit. \\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!  \\nCHAPTER 3  \\nJonathan Harker\\'s Journal Continued  \\nWhen I f\\nound that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. I \\nrushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every \\nwindow I could find, but after a little  the conviction of my helplessness \\noverpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I think I \\nmust have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. \\nWhen, however, the conviction had come to  me that I was helpless I sat down \\nquietly, as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life, and began to think \\nover what was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no \\ndefinite conclusion. Of one thing only am I certain. That  it is no use making my \\nideas known to the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned, and as he has \\ndone it himself, and has doubtless hi s own motives for it, he would only \\ndeceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my  fears to myself, and my eyes open. \\nI am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits, and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains \\nto get through.  \\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below \\nshut, and knew that the Count had retu rned. He did not come at once into the \\nlibrary, so I went cautious ly to my own room and f ound him making the bed. \\nThis was odd, but only co nfirmed what I had all alon g thought, that there are \\nno servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining room, I was assured of it. For if he \\ndoes himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terr ible thought, for if so, what does it \\nmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand for silence? How was it that all the peop le at Bistritz and on the coach had \\nsome terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, \\nof the wild rose, of the mountain ash?  \\nBless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! For it \\nis a comfort and a strength to me when ever I touch it. It is odd that a thing \\nwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a \\ntime of loneliness and trouble be of help.  Is it that there is something in the \\nessence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying \\nmemories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. Tonight he \\nmay talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, \\nhowever, not to awake his suspicion.  \\nMidnight.--I have had a long talk wi th the Count. I asked him a few \\nquestions on Transylvania  history, and he warmed up to the subject \\nwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he \\nspoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by \\nsaying that to a Boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate. Whenever  he spoke of his \\nhouse he always said \"we\", and spoke al most in the plural, li ke a king speaking. \\nI wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke, and walked ab out the room pulling his great white \\nmoustache and grasping anything on whic h he laid his hands as though he \\nwould crush it by main stren gth. One thing he said whic h I shall put down as \\nnearly as I can, for it tells in its  way the story of his race.  \\n\"We Szekelys have a right to be pro ud, for in our veins flows the blood of \\nmany brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the \\nwhirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the \\nfighting spirit which Thor  and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers \\ndisplayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, aye, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples  thought that the werew olves themselves had come. \\nHere, too, when they came, they found th e Huns, whose warlike fury had swept \\nthe earth like a living flame, till the dyin g peoples held that in their veins ran \\nthe blood of those old witche s, who, expelled from Sc ythia had mated with the \\ndevils in the desert. Fools, fools! What de vil or what witch was ever so great as \\nAttila, whose blood is in these veins?\" He  held up his arms. \"Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race, that we were proud, that when the Magyar, the \\nLombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the  Turk poured his thousands on our \\nfrontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he  found us here when he reached the \\nfrontier, that the Honfoglala s was completed there? A nd when the Hungarian \\nflood swept eastward, the Szek elys were claimed as k indred by the victorious \\nMagyars, and to us for centuries was trus ted the guarding of the frontier of \\nTurkeyland. Aye, and more than that, en dless duty of the frontier guard, for as \\nthe Turks say, \\'water sleeps, and the en emy is sleepless.\\' Who more gladly than \\nwe throughout the Four Nations received the \\'bloody sword,\\' or at its warlike \\ncall flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great \\nshame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own \\nrace who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? \\nThis was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unwort hy brother, when he \\nhad fallen, sold his people to the Tu rk and brought the shame of slavery on \\nthem! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who  inspired that othe r of his race who \\nin a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into \\nTurkeyland, who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he \\nhad to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alon e could ultimately triumph! They said \\nthat he thought only of himself. Bah! Wh at good are peasants without a leader? \\nWhere ends the war without a brain and he art to conduct it? Again, when, after \\nthe battle of Mohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula \\nblood were amongst their leaders, for our  spirit would not brook that we were \\nnot free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys, and the Dracula as their heart\\'s blood, \\ntheir brains, and their swords, can boas t a record that mushroom growths like \\nthe Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. \\nBlood is too precious a th ing in these days of dis honourable peace, and the \\nglories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\"  \\nIt was by this time close on morning,  and we went to bed. (Mem., this \\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of  the \"Arabian Nights,\" for everything \\nhas to break off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father.)  \\n12 May.--Let me begin with facts, bare , meager facts, verified by books \\nand figures, and of which there can be no  doubt. I must not confuse them with \\nexperiences which will have to rest on my own observat ion, or my memory of \\nthem. Last evening when the Count cam e from his room he began by asking \\nme questions on legal matters and on th e doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over books, a nd, simply to keep my mind occupied, \\nwent over some of the matters I had been  examined in at Lincoln\\'s Inn. There \\nwas a certain method in the Count\\'s inquirie s, so I shall try to put them down in \\nsequence. The knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.  \\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I \\ntold him he might have a dozen if he wi shed, but that it would not be wise to \\nhave more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act \\nat a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest. He \\nseemed thoroughly to understand, an d went on to ask if there would be any \\npractical difficulty in having one man to at tend, say, to banking, and another to \\nlook after shipping, in case local help were needed in  a place far from the home \\nof the banking solicitor. I asked to ex plain more fully, so that I might not by \\nany chance mislead him, so he said,  \\n\"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under \\nthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at Lo ndon. Good! Now here let \\nme say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services \\nof one so far off from London instead of  some one resident there, that my \\nmotive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only, and as \\none of London residence might, perhaps,  have some purpose of himself or \\nfriend to serve, I went thus afield to se ek my agent, whose labours should be \\nonly to my interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship \\ngoods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or  Harwich, or Dove r, might it not be \\nthat it could with more ease be done by  consigning to one in these ports?\"  \\nI answered that certainly it would be most  easy, but that we solicitors had a \\nsystem of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on \\ninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wish es carried out by him  without further \\ntrouble.  \\n\"But,\" said he, \"I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\"  \\n\"Of course,\" I replied, and \"Such is  often done by men of business, who do \\nnot like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\"  \\n\"Good!\" he said, and then went on to  ask about the means of making \\nconsignments and the forms to be gone th rough, and of all sorts of difficulties \\nwhich might arise, but by fore thought could be guarded against. I explained all \\nthese things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was \\nnothing that he did not th ink of or foresee. For a man who was never in the \\ncountry, and who did not evidently do  much in the way of business, his \\nknowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on \\nthese points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by \\nthe books available, he suddenly st ood up and said, \"Have you written since \\nyour first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?\"  \\nIt was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that \\nas yet I had not seen any opportuni ty of sending letters to anybody.  \\n\"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, laying a heavy hand on my \\nshoulder, \"write to our friend and to a ny other, and say, if  it will please you, \\nthat you shall stay with me  until a month from now.\"  \\n\"Do you wish me to stay so long?\" I as ked, for my heart grew cold at the \\nthought.  \\n\"I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal. When your master, employer, \\nwhat you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was \\nunderstood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have no t stinted. Is it not \\nso?\"  \\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It  was Mr. Hawkins\\' interest, not \\nmine, and I had to think of him, not my self, and besides, while Count Dracula \\nwas speaking, there was that in his eyes  and in his bearin g which made me \\nremember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. \\nThe Count saw his victory in my bow, a nd his mastery in the trouble of my \\nface, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way.  \\n\"I pray you, my good young friend, th at you will not di scourse of things \\nother than business in  your letters. It will doubtles s please your friends to know \\nthat you are well, and that you look fo rward to getting home to them. Is it not \\nso?\" As he spoke he handed me three sh eets of note paper and three envelopes. \\nThey were all of the thinnest foreign po st, and looking at them, then at him, and \\nnoticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, can ine teeth lying over the red underlip, \\nI understood as well as if he had spok en that I should be more careful what I \\nwrote, for he would be able to read it . So I determined to write only formal \\nnotes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins  in secret, and also to Mina, for to \\nher I could write shorthand, which woul d puzzle the Count, if he did see it. \\nWhen I had written my two letters I sa t quiet, reading a book whilst the Count \\nwrote several notes, referring as he  wrote them to some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed th em with his own, and put by his writing \\nmaterials, after which, the instant the d oor had closed behind him, I leaned over \\nand looked at the letters, which were face down on the table. I felt no \\ncompunction in doing so for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect \\nmyself in every way I could.  \\nOne of the letters was directed to Sa muel F. Billington, No. 7, The \\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutne r, Varna. The third was to Coutts & \\nCo., London, and the fourth to Herren Kl opstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda \\nPesth. The second and fourth were unseal ed. I was just about to look at them \\nwhen I saw the door handle move. I sank  back in my seat, having just had time \\nto resume my book before the Count, hol ding still another le tter in his hand, \\nentered the room. He took up the lett ers on the table and stamped them \\ncarefully, and then turning to me, said,  \\n\"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this \\nevening. You will, I hope, f ind all things as you wish.\"  At the door he turned, \\nand after a moment\\'s pause said, \"Let me advise you, my dear young friend. \\nNay, let me warn you w ith all seriousness, that sh ould you leave these rooms \\nyou will not by any chance go to sleep in a ny other part of the castle. It is old, \\nand has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be warned! Should sleep now or  ever overcome you, or be like to do, \\nthen haste to your own chamber or to the se rooms, for your rest will then be \\nsafe. But if you be not careful in this respec t, then,\" He finished his speech in a \\ngruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them. I \\nquite understood. My only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more \\nterrible than the unnatural , horrible net of gloom an d mystery which seemed \\nclosing around me.  \\nLater.--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in \\nquestion. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not. I have placed the \\ncrucifix over the head of my bed, I im agine that my rest is thus freer from \\ndreams, and there it shall remain.  \\nWhen he left me I went to my room . After a little while, not hearing any \\nsound, I came out and went up the stone st air to where I could look out towards \\nthe South. There was some sense of fr eedom in the vast e xpanse, inaccessible \\nthough it was to me, as compared with th e narrow darkness of the courtyard. \\nLooking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a \\nbreath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am begi nning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is dest roying my nerve. I start at my own \\nshadow, and am full of all sorts of horri ble imaginings. God knows that there is \\nground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the \\nbeautiful expanse, bathed in so ft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as \\nday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me. \\nThere was peace and comfort in every br eath I drew. As I leaned from the \\nwindow my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and \\nsomewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count\\'s own room would look out. The window at which I \\nstood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned,  and though weatherworn, was still \\ncomplete. But it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I \\ndrew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.  \\nWhat I saw was the Count\\'s head co ming out from the window. I did not \\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and \\narms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had some many \\nopportunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it \\nis wonderful how small a ma tter will interest and amuse a man when he is a \\nprisoner. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the \\nwhole man slowly emerge from the win dow and begin to cr awl down the castle \\nwall over the dreadful abyss, face dow n with his cloak sp reading out around \\nhim like great wings. At first I could n ot believe my eyes. I thought it was some \\ntrick of the moonlight, some weird eff ect of shadow, but I kept looking, and it \\ncould be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, \\nworn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every \\nprojection and inequality move downwards  with considerable speed, just as a \\nlizard moves along a wall.  \\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature, is it in the \\nsemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me. I \\nam in fear, in awful fear, and there is no escape for me. I am encompassed \\nabout with terrors that I dare not think of.  \\n15 May.--Once more I have seen the co unt go out in his li zard fashion. He \\nmoved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good \\ndeal to the left. He vanished into so me hole or window. When his head had \\ndisappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail. The distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, \\nand thought to use the opportu nity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp , tried all the doors. They were all \\nlocked, as I had expected, and the locks  were comparatively new. But I went \\ndown the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered origina lly. I found I could \\npull back the bolts easily enough and un hook the great chains. But the door was \\nlocked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count\\'s room. I must \\nwatch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to \\nmake a thorough examination of the variou s stairs and passages, and to try the \\ndoors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, \\nbut there was nothing to see in them ex cept old furniture, dusty with age and \\nmoth-eaten. At last, however, I found one d oor at the top of the stairway which, \\nthough it seemed locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and \\nfound that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact \\nthat the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. \\nHere was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and \\nwith many efforts forced it back so tha t I could enter. I was now in a wing of \\nthe castle further to the right than th e rooms I knew and a storey lower down. \\nFrom the windows I could see that the su ite of rooms lay al ong to the south of \\nthe castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On \\nthe latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle \\nwas built on the corner of a great rock , so that on three sides it was quite \\nimpregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or \\nculverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guar ded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, \\nand then, rising far away, great jagged m ountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, \\nthe sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and cran nies of the stone. This wa s evidently the portion of \\nthe castle occupied by the ladies in bygone  days, for the furniture had more an \\nair of comfort than any I had seen.  \\nThe windows were curtainless, and th e yellow moonlig ht, flooding in \\nthrough the diamond panes, ena bled one to see even colour s, whilst it softened \\nthe wealth of dust which lay over a ll and disguised in some measure the \\nravages of time and moth. My lamp seemed to be of little eff ect in the brilliant \\nmoonlight, but I was glad to have it with me , for there was a dread loneliness in \\nthe place which chilled my heart and made  my nerves tremble. Still, it was \\nbetter than living alone in the rooms w hich I had come to hate from the \\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a \\nsoft quietude come over me. Here I am, si tting at a little oak table where in old \\ntimes possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much though t and many blushes, \\nher ill-spelt love letter, and writin g in my diary in shorthand all that has \\nhappened since I closed it last. It is the nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and \\nhave, powers of their own which mere \"modernity\" cannot kill.  \\nLater: The morning of 16 May.--God pr eserve my sanity, for to this I am \\nreduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past. Whilst I live \\non here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be \\nnot mad already. If I be sane, then sure ly it is maddening to think that of all the \\nfoul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me, \\nthat to him alone I can look for safety, ev en though this be only whilst I can \\nserve his purpose. Great God! Merciful God, let me be calm, for out of that \\nway lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite kne w what Shakespeare meant when he \\nmade Hamlet say, \"My tablets ! Quick, my tablets! \\'tis  meet that I put it down,\" \\netc., For now, feeling as though my own br ain were unhinged or as if the shock \\nhad come which must end in its undoing,  I turn to my diary for repose. The \\nhabit of entering accuratel y must help to soothe me.  \\nThe Count\\'s mysterious warning frighte ned me at the time. It frightens me \\nmore not when I think of it, for in the future he has a fearful hold upon me. I \\nshall fear to doubt what he may say!  \\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and \\npen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Co unt\\'s warning came into my mind, but I \\ntook pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the \\nobstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft mo onlight soothe d, and the \\nwide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return tonight to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung an d lived sweet lives whilst their gentle \\nbreasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I \\ndrew a great couch out of its place near th e corner, so that as I lay, I could look \\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and un caring for the dust, \\ncomposed myself for sleep. I suppose I mu st have fallen asleep. I hope so, but I \\nfear, for all that followed was startlingly real, so real that now sitting here in \\nthe broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in th e least believe that it was \\nall sleep.  \\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I \\ncame into it. I could see alon g the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own \\nfootsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, they \\nthrew no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for \\nsome time, and then whispered together.  Two were dark, and had high aquiline \\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, pi ercing eyes, that seemed to be almost \\nred when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as \\ncan be, with great masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed \\nsomehow to know her face,  and to know it in connection with some dreamy \\nfear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where. All three had \\nbrilliant white teeth that sh one like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous \\nlips. There was something about them tha t made me uneasy, some longing and \\nat the same time some deadly fear. I fe lt in my heart a wicked, burning desire \\nthat they would kiss me w ith those red lips. It is no t good to note this down, \\nlest some day it should meet Mina\\'s eyes and cause her pain, but it is the truth. \\nThey whispered together, and then they all three laughed, such a silvery, \\nmusical laugh, but as hard  as though the sound never could have come through \\nthe softness of human lips. It was like  the intolerable, ting ling sweetness of \\nwaterglasses when played on by a cunni ng hand. The fair girl shook her head \\ncoquettishly, and the oth er two urged her on.  \\nOne said, \"Go on! You are first, and we  shall follow. Yours is the right to \\nbegin.\"  \\nThe other added, \"He is young and st rong. There are kisses for us all.\"  \\nI lay quiet, looking out from under my ey elashes in an agony of delightful \\nanticipation. The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the \\nmovement of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and \\nsent the same tingling through the nerv es as her voice, but with a bitter \\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.  \\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the \\nlashes. The girl went on her knees, an d bent over me, simply gloating. There \\nwas a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as \\nshe arched her neck she actually licked he r lips like an animal, till I could see \\nin the moonlight the moisture  shining on the scarlet lips  and on the red tongue \\nas it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lo wer and lower went her head as the lips \\nwent below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the c hurning sound of her tongue as it licked \\nher teeth and lips, and I could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of \\nmy throat began to tingle as one\\'s flesh does  when the hand that  is to tickle it \\napproaches nearer, nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of tw o sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited, \\nwaited with beating heart.  \\nBut at that instant, another sensat ion swept through me as quick as \\nlightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if \\nlapped in a storm of fury. As my ey es opened involuntarily I saw his strong \\nhand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant\\'s power draw it \\nback, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, \\nand the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I \\nimagine such wrath and fury, even to the  demons of the pit. His eyes were \\npositively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell fire \\nblazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard \\nlike drawn wires. The thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a \\nheaving bar of white-hot me tal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the \\nwoman from him, and then motioned to th e others, as though he were beating \\nthem back. It was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. \\nIn a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through \\nthe air and then ring in the room he said,  \\n\"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him \\nwhen I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware \\nhow you meddle with him, or you\\'ll have to deal with me.\"  \\nThe fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him. \"You \\nyourself never loved. You never love !\" On this the other women joined, and \\nsuch a mirthless, hard, soulless laug hter rang through the room that it almost \\nmade me faint to hear. It seemed  like the pleasure of fiends.  \\nThen the Count turned, after looking at  my face attentively, and said in a \\nsoft whisper, \"Yes, I too can love. You yo urselves can tell it from the past. Is it \\nnot so? Well, now I promise you that wh en I am done with him you shall kiss \\nhim at your will. Now go! Go! I must aw aken him, for there is work to be \\ndone.\"  \\n\"Are we to have nothing to night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh, as \\nshe pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved \\nas though there were some living thin g within it. For answ er he nodded his \\nhead. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not \\ndeceive me there was a gasp and a low wa il, as of a half sm othered child. The \\nwomen closed round, whilst I was agha st with horror. But as I looked, they \\ndisappeared, and with them the dreadful ba g. There was no door near them, and \\nthey could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight a nd pass out throug h the window, for I \\ncould see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely \\nfaded away.  \\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.  \\nCHAPTER 4  \\nJonathan Harker\\'s Journal Continued  \\nI awoke in m\\ny own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have \\ncarried me here. I tried to satisfy myself  on the subject, but could not arrive at \\nany unquestionable result. To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such \\nas that my clothes were folded and laid  by in a manner which was not my habit. \\nMy watch was still unwound, and I am  rigorously accustom ed to wind it the \\nlast thing before going to  bed, and many such details . But these things are no \\nproof, for they may have been evidence s that my mind was not as usual, and, \\nfor some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for \\nproof. Of one thing I am glad. If it was that the Count carried me here and \\nundressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. \\nI am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not \\nhave brooked. He would have taken or de stroyed it. As I look round this room, \\nalthough it has been to me so full of f ear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for \\nnothing can be more dreadful than th ose awful women, who were, who are, \\nwaiting to suck my blood.  \\n18 May.--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I \\nmust know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found \\nit closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the \\nwoodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.  I fear it was no dream, and must act on \\nthis surmise.  \\n19 May.--I am surely in the toils. La st night the Cou nt asked me in the \\nsuavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home wi thin a few days, another that I was \\nstarting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had \\nleft the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in \\nthe present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count \\nwhilst I am so absolutely in his power. And to refuse would be to excite his \\nsuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him. My only chance is to prolong my \\nopportunities. Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape. I \\nsaw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained to me that posts were few and \\nuncertain, and that my writi ng now would ensure ease of mind to my friends. \\nAnd he assured me with so much impres siveness that he would countermand \\nthe later letters, which would be held ove r at Bistritz until due time in case \\nchance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to  oppose him would have \\nbeen to create new suspicion. I therefore  pretended to fall in with his views, \\nand asked him what dates I should put on the letters.  \\nHe calculated a minute, and then said, \"The first should be June 12, the \\nsecond June 19, and the third June 29.\"  \\nI know now the span of my  life. God help me!  \\n28 May.--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate  of being able to send \\nword home. A band of Szgany have come  to the castle, an d are encamped in \\nthe courtyard. These are gipsies. I have notes of them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordina ry gipsies all the \\nworld over. There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law. They  attach themselves as a r ule to some great noble or \\nboyar, and call themselves by his name. Th ey are fearless and without religion, \\nsave superstition, and they talk only their  own varieties of the Romany tongue.  \\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them \\nposted. I have already spoken to them through my window to begin \\nacquaintanceship. They to ok their hats off and made obeisance and many signs, \\nwhich however, I could not understand any more than I could their spoken \\nlanguage  \\nI have written the letters. Mina\\'s is  in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. \\nHawkins to communicate with her. To he r I have explained my situation, but \\nwithout the horrors which I may only surm ise. It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her.  Should the letters not carry, then the \\nCount shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge.  \\nI have given the letters. I threw them  through the bars of  my window with \\na gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them pos ted. The man who \\ntook them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap. I \\ncould do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to read. As the Count did \\nnot come in, I have written here  \\nThe Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest \\nvoice as he opened two letters, \"The Sz gany has given me these, of which, \\nthough I know not whence they come, I sh all, of course, ta ke care. See!\"--He \\nmust have looked at it.--\"One is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins. \\nThe other,\"--here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the \\nenvelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly,--\\n\"The other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is not signed. Well! So it cannot matter to us.\" And he calmly held letter and \\nenvelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed.  \\nThen he went on, \"The letter to Haw kins, that I shall, of course send on, \\nsince it is yours. Your letters are sacr ed to me. Your pard on, my friend, that \\nunknowingly I did break th e seal. Will you not cover it  again?\" He held out the \\nletter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope.  \\nI could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When he went out of \\nthe room I could hear the key turn softly.  A minute later I went over and tried it, \\nand the door was locked.  \\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his \\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very \\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, \\nhe said, \"So, my friend, you are tired? Ge t to bed. There is the surest rest. I may \\nnot have the pleasure of talk tonight,  since there are many labours to me, but \\nyou will sleep, I pray.\"  \\nI passed to my room and went to bed,  and, strange to say, slept without \\ndreaming. Despair has its own calms.  31 May.--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself \\nwith some papers and envelopes from my  bag and keep them in my pocket, so \\nthat I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, \\nagain a shock!  \\nEvery scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, \\nrelating to railways and travel, my le tter of credit, in fact all that might be \\nuseful to me were I once outside the ca stle. I sat and pondered awhile, and then \\nsome thought occurred to me, and I made  search of my portmanteau and in the \\nwardrobe where I had placed my clothes.  \\nThe suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug. \\nI could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new scheme of \\nvillainy  \\n17 June.--This morning, as I was sitti ng on the edge of my bed cudgelling \\nmy brains, I heard without a crackling of whips and poundi ng and scraping of \\nhorses\\' feet up the rocky path beyond th e courtyard. With joy I hurried to the \\nwindow, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by \\neight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, \\ngreat nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their \\nlong staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to desce nd and try and join \\nthem through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. \\nAgain a shock, my door was fastened on the outside.  \\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me stupidly \\nand pointed, but ju st then the \"hetman\" of the Szgany came out, and seeing \\nthem pointing to my window , said something, at which they laughed.  \\nHenceforth no effort of mine, no piteou s cry or agonized entreaty, would \\nmake them even look at me. They re solutely turned away. The leiter-wagons \\ncontained great, square boxes, with handle s of thick rope. Thes e were evidently \\nempty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their \\nresonance as they were roughly moved.  \\nWhen they were all unloaded and packed  in a great heap in one corner of \\nthe yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it \\nfor luck, lazily went each to his horse\\'s  head. Shortly afte rwards, I heard the \\ncrackling of their whips di e away in the distance.   \\n24 June.--Last night the Count left me  early, and locked himself into his \\nown room. As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, an d looked out of the \\nwindow, which opened South. I thought I would watch for the Count, for there \\nis something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and \\nare doing work of some kind. I know it , for now and then, I hear a far-away \\nmuffled sound as of mattock and spade, a nd, whatever it is, it must be the end \\nof some ruthless villainy.  \\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw \\nsomething coming out of the Count\\'s window. I drew back and watched \\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to find that \\nhe had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung \\nover his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away. \\nThere could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb , too! This, then, is his \\nnew scheme of evil, that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he \\nmay both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting \\nmy own letters, and that any wickedne ss which he may do shall by the local \\npeople be attributed to me.  \\nIt makes me rage to think that this can  go on, and whilst I am shut up here, \\na veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a \\ncriminal\\'s right an d consolation.  \\nI thought I would watch for the Count\\' s return, and for a long time sat \\ndoggedly at the window. Then I began to  notice that there were some quaint \\nlittle specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest \\ngrains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous \\nsort of way. I watched them with a sens e of soothing, and a sort of calm stole \\nover me. I leaned back in the embrasure in  a more comfortable position, so that \\nI could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling.  \\nSomething made me start up, a low , piteous howling of dogs somewhere \\nfar below in the valley, which was hidden  from my sight. Louder it seemed to \\nring in my ears, and the floating moats of dust to take new shapes to the sound \\nas they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call \\nof my instincts. Nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered \\nsensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised!  \\nQuicker and quicker danced the dust.  The moonbeams seemed to quiver as \\nthey went by me into the mass of gloom be yond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom sh apes. And then I started, broad awake \\nand in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place.  \\nThe phantom shapes, which were b ecoming gradually materialised from \\nthe moonbeams, were those three gho stly women to whom I was doomed.  \\nI fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no \\nmoonlight, and where the lamp was burning brightly.  \\nWhen a couple of hours had passed  I heard something  stirring in the \\nCount\\'s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed. And then there \\nwas silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried \\nthe door, but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I sat down and \\nsimply cried.  \\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courty ard without, the agonised cry of a \\nwoman. I rushed to the window, and thro wing it up, peered between the bars.  \\nThere, indeed, was a woman with dishe velled hair, holding her hands over \\nher heart as one distressed with running.  She was leaning against the corner of \\nthe gateway. When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with men ace, \"Monster, give me my child!\"  \\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same \\nwords in tones which wrung my heart. Th en she tore her hair and beat her \\nbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion. \\nFinally, she threw herself forward, and though I could not see her, I could hear \\nthe beating of her naked hands against the door.  \\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on th e tower, I heard the voice of the \\nCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be answered \\nfrom far and wide by the howling of w olves. Before many minutes had passed \\na pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide \\nentrance into the courtyard.  \\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but \\nshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.  \\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had beco me of her child, and she \\nwas better dead.  What shall I do? What can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful thing \\nof night, gloom, and fear?  \\n25 June.--No man knows till he has su ffered from the night how sweet and \\ndear to his heart and eye the morning can  be. When the sun grew so high this \\nmorning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the \\nhigh spot which it touched seemed to me as  if the dove from the ark had lighted \\nthere. My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which \\ndissolved in the warmth.  \\nI must take action of some sort whils t the courage of the day is upon me. \\nLast night one of my post-dated letters went  to post, the first of that fatal series \\nwhich is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.  \\nLet me not think of it. Action!  It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or \\nin some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. \\nCan it be that he sleeps when others wa ke, that he may be awake whilst they \\nsleep? If I could only get into his room ! But there is no possible way. The door \\nis always locked, no way for me.  \\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where hi s body has gone why \\nmay not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his window. \\nWhy should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The chances are \\ndesperate, but my need is more desperate s till. I shall risk it. At the worst it can \\nonly be death, and a man\\'s death is not a calf\\'s, and the dreaded Hereafter may \\nstill be open to me. God help me in my task! Goodbye, Mina , if I fail. Goodbye, \\nmy faithful friend and second father. Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!  \\nSame day, later.--I have made the ef fort, and God helping me, have come \\nsafely back to this room. I must put dow n every detail in order. I went whilst \\nmy courage was fresh straight to the wi ndow on the south si de, and at once got \\noutside on this side. The stones are big an d roughly cut, and the mortar has by \\nprocess of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and \\nventured out on the desperate way. I lo oked down once, so as to make sure that \\na sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that \\nkept my eyes away from it. I know pret ty well the direction and distance of the Count\\'s window, and made for it as well  as I could, having regard to the \\nopportunities available. I did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was too excited, and \\nthe time seemed ridiculous ly short till I found myself standing on the window \\nsill and trying to raise up the sash. I wa s filled with agitation, however, when I \\nbent down and slid feet foremost in thr ough the window. Then I looked around \\nfor the Count, but with surprise and gla dness, made a discovery. The room was \\nempty! It was barely furnished with od d things, which seemed to have never \\nbeen used.  \\nThe furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and \\nwas covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I \\ncould not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in \\none corner, gold of all kinds, Roman, a nd British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, \\nand Greek and Turkish money, covered w ith a film of dust, as though it had \\nlain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred \\nyears old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.  \\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I could \\nnot find the key of the room or the ke y of the outer door, which was the main \\nobject of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would \\nbe in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, \\nwhich went steeply down.  \\nI descended, minding carefully where I went for the stairs were dark, being \\nonly lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, \\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went throu gh the passage the smell grew closer \\nand heavier. At last I pulled open a h eavy door which stood ajar, and found \\nmyself in an old ruined chapel, which ha d evidently been used as a graveyard. \\nThe roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the \\nground had recently been dug over, a nd the earth placed in great wooden boxes, \\nmanifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks.  \\nThere was nobody about, and I made a search over every inch of the \\nground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the \\ndim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of \\nthese I went, but saw nothing except fragme nts of old coffins and piles of dust. \\nIn the third, however, I made a discovery.  \\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile \\nof newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asl eep. I could not say which, for eyes were open and stony, bu t without the glassiness of death, and \\nthe cheeks had the warmth of life through a ll their pallor. The lips were as red \\nas ever. But there was no sign of moveme nt, no pulse, no breath, no beating of \\nthe heart.  \\nI bent over him, and tried to find any si gn of life, but in vain. He could not \\nhave lain there long, for the earthy sm ell would have passed away in a few \\nhours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I \\nthought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the \\ndead eyes, and in them d ead though they were, such  a look of hate, though \\nunconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count\\'s room by the window , crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my \\nroom, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think.  \\n29 June.--Today is the date of my last  letter, and the Count has taken steps \\nto prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same \\nwindow, and in my clothes. As he went d own the wall, lizard fashion, I wished \\nI had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him. But I fear that no \\nweapon wrought along by man\\'s hand wou ld have any effect on him. I dared \\nnot wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to \\nthe library, and read there till I fell asleep.  \\nI was awakened by the Cou nt, who looked at me as grimly as a man could \\nlook as he said, \"Tomorrow, my frie nd, we must part. You return to your \\nbeautiful England, I to some work whic h may have such an end that we may \\nnever meet. Your letter home has been despatched. Tomorrow I shall not be \\nhere, but all shall be ready for your j ourney. In the morning come the Szgany, \\nwho have some labours of their own here , and also come some Slovaks. When \\nthey have gone, my carriage shall come  for you, and shall bear you to the \\nBorgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes \\nthat I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.\"  \\nI suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems \\nlike a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so \\nI asked him point-blank, \"W hy may I not go tonight?\"  \\n\"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\"  \\n\"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\"  He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabo lical smile that I knew there was \\nsome trick behind his smoothness. He said, \"And your baggage?\"  \\n\"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\"  \\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub \\nmy eyes, it seemed so real, \"You Englis h have a saying which is close to my \\nheart, for its spirit is that which rule s our boyars, \\'Welcome the coming, speed \\nthe parting guest.\\' Come with me, my dear  young friend. Not an hour shall you \\nwait in my house against your  will, though sad am I at  your going, and that you \\nso suddenly desire it. Come!\" With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, \\npreceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly  he stopped. \"Hark!\"  \\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the \\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra \\nseems to leap under the baton of the co nductor. After a pause of a moment, he \\nproceeded, in his stately way, to the do or, drew back the ponderous bolts, \\nunhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.  \\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I \\nlooked all round, b ut could see no key of any kind.  \\nAs the door began to open, the howl ing of the wolves without grew louder \\nand angrier. Their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as \\nthey leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew than that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.  With such allies as these at his \\ncommand, I could do nothing.  \\nBut still the door cont inued slowly to open, and only the Count\\'s body \\nstood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and \\nmeans of my doom. I was to be given to th e wolves, and at my own instigation. \\nThere was a diabolical wickedness in th e idea great enough fo r the Count, and \\nas the last chance I cried out, \"Shut the door! I shall wait till morning.\" And I \\ncovered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.  \\nWith one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and \\nthe great bolts clanged and echoed through  the hall as they shot back into their \\nplaces.  \\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to \\nmy own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might \\nbe proud of.  \\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a \\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly  and listened. Unless my ears deceived \\nme, I heard the voice of the Count.  \\n\"Back! Back to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have \\npatience! Tonight is mine. Tomorrow night is yours!\"  \\nThere was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the \\ndoor, and saw without the three terrible wom en licking their lips. As I appeared, \\nthey all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.  \\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near \\nthe end? Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!  \\n30 June.--These may be the last words I ever write in this diary. I slept till \\njust before the dawn, and when I wo ke threw myself on my knees, for I \\ndetermined that if Death came he should find me ready.  \\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had \\ncome. Then came the welcome cockcrow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad \\nheart, I opened the door and ran down th e hall. I had seen that the door was \\nunlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with \\neagerness, I unhooked the chains a nd threw back the massive bolts.  \\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled and pulled at the \\ndoor, and shook it till, massive as it was,  it rattled in its casement. I could see \\nthe bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the Count.  \\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain the key at any risk, and I determined \\nthen and there to scale the wall again, and gain the Count\\'s room. He might kill \\nme, but death now seemed the happier ch oice of evils. Without a pause I rushed \\nup to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count\\'s \\nroom. It was empty, but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, \\nbut the heap of gold remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well \\nenough where to find the monster I sought.  The great box was in the same place, cl ose against the wall , but the lid was \\nlaid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be \\nhammered home.  \\nI knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it \\nback against the wall. And then I saw something which filled my very soul \\nwith horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half restored. For the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey. The \\ncheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath. The mouth \\nwas redder than ever, for on the lips were  gouts of fresh bl ood, which trickled \\nfrom the corners of the mouth and ran down over the chin and neck. Even the \\ndeep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swoll en flesh, for the lids and pouches \\nunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply \\ngorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.  \\nI shuddered as I bent over to touch him , and every sense in me revolted at \\nthe contact, but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my \\nown body a banquet in a similar war to those horrid three. I felt all over the \\nbody, but no sign could I find of the key.  Then I stopped and looked at the \\nCount. There was a mocking smile on th e bloated face which seemed to drive \\nme mad. This was the being I was he lping to transfer to London, where, \\nperhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate \\nhis lust for blood, and create a new and ev er-widening circle of semi-demons to \\nbatten on the helpless.  \\nThe very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the \\nworld of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a \\nshovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, \\nstruck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me, with a ll their blaze of basilisk horror. The \\nsight seemed to paralyze me, and the sh ovel turned in my hand and glanced \\nfrom the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pul led it away the flange of the blade \\ncaught the edge of the lid which fell ove r again, and hid the horrid thing from \\nmy sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and \\nfixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost \\nhell.  \\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed \\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and \\nthrough their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips. The Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a \\nlast look around and at the  box which contained the vile body, I ran from the \\nplace and gained the Count\\'s room, dete rmined to rush out at the moment the \\ndoor should be opened. With strained ear s, I listened, and heard downstairs the \\ngrinding of the key in the great lock a nd the falling back of the heavy door. \\nThere must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors.  \\nThen there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some \\npassage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the \\nvault, where I might find the new entrance, but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the d oor to the winding stair blew to with a \\nshock that set the dust from the lintels  flying. When I ran to push it open, I \\nfound that it was hopelessly fast. I was ag ain a prisoner, and the net of doom \\nwas closing round me more closely.  \\nAs I write there is in the passage be low a sound of many tramping feet and \\nthe crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their \\nfreight of earth. There was a sound of hammering. It is the box being nailed \\ndown. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many \\nother idle feet coming behind them.  \\nThe door is shut, the chains rattle. There is a grinding of the key in the lock. \\nI can hear the key withdrawn, then anot her door opens and shuts. I hear the \\ncreaking of lock and bolt.  \\nHark! In the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, \\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Sz gany as they pass into the distance.  \\nI am alone in the castle with those horrible women. Faugh! Mina is a \\nwoman, and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!  \\nI shall not remain alone with them. I shall try to scale the castle wall \\nfarther than I have yet attempted. I sha ll take some of the gold with me, lest I \\nwant it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.  \\nAnd then away for home! Away to the quickest and nearest train! Away \\nfrom the cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his children \\nstill walk with earthly feet!  At least God\\'s mercy is better tha n that of those monsters, and the \\nprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep, as a man. Goodbye, all. \\nMina!  \\nCHAPTER 5  \\nLETTER FROM MISS MINA MURRAY  TO MI SS LUCY WESTENRA  \\n9 May.  \\nMy dearest Lucy,  Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed \\nwith work. The life of an assistant scho olmistress is sometimes trying. I am \\nlonging to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and \\nbuild our castles in the air. I have been  working very hard lately, because I \\nwant to keep up with Jonathan\\'s studies, and I have been practicing shorthand \\nvery assiduously. When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, \\nand if I can stenograph well enough I ca n take down what he wants to say in \\nthis way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am \\npracticing very hard.  \\nHe and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a \\nstenographic journal of his travels abro ad. When I am with you I shall keep a \\ndiary in the same way. I don\\'t mean one of those two-pa ges-to-the-week-with-\\nSunday-squeezed- in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of jou rnal which I can write in \\nwhenever I feel inclined.  \\nI do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people, but it is not \\nintended for them. I may show it to Jonath an some day if there is in it anything \\nworth sharing, but it is really an exercise  book. I shall try to do what I see lady \\njournalists do, interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember \\nconversations. I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that \\ngoes on or that one hears said during a day.  \\nHowever, we shall see. I will tell you of my little  plans when we meet. I \\nhave just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well, \\nand will be returning in about a week. I am  longing to hear all his news. It must be nice to see strange countries. I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan and I, shall \\never see them together. There is the ten o\\'clock bell ringing. Goodbye.  \\nYour loving  \\nMina  \\nTell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for a \\nlong time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome, curly-haired \\nman???  \\nLETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY  \\n17, Chatham Street  \\nWednesday  \\nMy dearest Mina,  \\nI must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I \\nwrote you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your second. \\nBesides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to interest you.  \\nTown is very pleasant just now, and we go a great deal to picture-galleries \\nand for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-hair ed man, I suppose \\nit was the one who was with me at the la st Pop. Someone has evidently been \\ntelling tales.  \\nThat was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and Mamma \\nget on very well together, they have so ma ny things to talk about in common.  \\nWe met some time ago a man that would  just do for you, if you were not \\nalready engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, \\nand of good birth. He is a doctor and really  clever. Just fancy! He is only nine-\\nand twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum a ll under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he ca lled here to see us, and often comes \\nnow. I think he is one of the most reso lute men I ever saw, and yet the most \\ncalm. He seems absolutely imperturbabl e. I can fancy what a wonderful power \\nhe must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of lo oking one straight in \\nthe face, as if trying to read one\\'s thou ghts. He tries this on very much with me, \\nbut I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass.  \\nDo you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you it is not a \\nbad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have \\nnever tried it.  \\nHe says that I afford him a curiou s psychological s tudy, and I humbly \\nthink I do. I do not, as you know, take suffic ient interest in dress to be able to \\ndescribe the new fashions. Dress is a bore.  That is slang again, but never mind. \\nArthur says that every day.  \\nThere, it is all out, Mina, we have to ld all our secrets to each other since \\nwe were children. We have slept togeth er and eaten together, and laughed and \\ncried together, and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, \\nMina, couldn\\'t you guess? I love him. I am  blushing as I write, for although I \\nthink he loves me, he has not told me so in words. But, oh, Mina, I love him. I \\nlove him! There, that does me good.  \\nI wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to \\nsit, and I would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this \\neven to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don\\'t want \\nto stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell \\nme all that you think about it. Mina, pray for my happiness.  \\nLucy  \\nP.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Goodnight again. L.  \\nLETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY  \\n24 May  My dearest Mina,  \\nThanks, and thanks, and thanks again fo r your sweet letter. It was so nice \\nto be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.  \\nMy dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here \\nam I, who shall be twenty in September , and yet I never had a proposal till \\ntoday, not a real proposal, and today I ha d three. Just fancy! Three proposals in \\none day! Isn\\'t it awful! I feel sorry, real ly and truly sorry, for two of the poor \\nfellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don\\'t know what to do with myself. \\nAnd three proposals! But, for goodness\\' sake , don\\'t tell any of the girls, or they \\nwould be getting all sorts of extrav agant ideas, and im agining themselves \\ninjured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least. \\nSome girls are so vain! You and I, M ina dear, who are engaged and are going \\nto settle down soon soberly into old marri ed women, can despise vanity. Well, I \\nmust tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every \\none except, of course, Jona than. You will tell him, becau se I would, if I were in \\nyour place, certainly tell Arthur. A woma n ought to tell her hu sband everything. \\nDon\\'t you think so, dear? A nd I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their \\nwives, to be quite as fair as they are.  And women, I am afraid, are not always \\nquite as fair as they should be.  \\nWell, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. \\nJohn Seward, the lunatic asylum ma n, with the strong jaw and the good \\nforehead. He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had \\nevidently been schooling himself as to al l sorts of little things, and remembered \\nthem, but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don\\'t \\ngenerally do when they are cool, and th en when he wanted to appear at ease he \\nkept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to \\nme, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he \\nhad known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer \\nhim. He was going to tell me how unha ppy he would be if I did not care for \\nhim, but when he saw me cry he said he was a brute and would not add to my \\npresent trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could l ove him in time, and \\nwhen I shook my head his hands tremble d, and then with some hesitation he \\nasked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence fr om me, but only to know, because if \\na woman\\'s heart was free a man might ha ve hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort \\nof duty to tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong  and very grave as he took both my \\nhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that If I ever wanted a \\nfriend I must count him one of my best.  Oh, Mina dear, I can\\'t help crying, and yo u must excuse this letter being all \\nblotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn\\'t \\nat all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fe llow, whom you know loves \\nyou honestly, going away and looking all broken hear ted, and to know that, no \\nmatter what he may say at the moment, yo u are passing out of his life. My dear, \\nI must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.  \\nEvening.  \\nArthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I \\ncan go on telling you about the day.  \\nWell, my dear, number Two came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an \\nAmerican from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost \\nimpossible that he has been to so many places and has such adventures. I \\nsympathize with poor Desdemona when she had such a stream poured in her \\near, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that we \\nthink a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now what I \\nwould do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don\\'t, for \\nthere was Mr. Morris telling us his s tories, and Arthur never told any, and \\nyet  \\nMy dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr . Quincy P. Morris found me alone. \\nIt seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, he doesn\\'t, for Arthur \\ntried twice to make a chance, and I helpin g him all I could, I am not ashamed to \\nsay it now. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn\\'t always speak \\nslang, that is to say, he never does so to  strangers or before them, for he is \\nreally well educated and has exquisite manners, but he found out that it amused \\nme to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was \\nno one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my dear, he has to \\ninvent it all, for it fits exactly into whatev er else he has to say. But this is a way \\nslang has. I do not know myself if I sh all ever speak sla ng. I do not know if \\nArthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet.  \\nWell, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he \\ncould, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous. He took my hand \\nin his, and said ever so sweetly  \\n\"Miss Lucy, I know I ain\\'t good enough to regulate the fixin\\'s of your little \\nshoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them \\nseven young women with the lamps when  you quit. Won\\'t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the  long road together, driving in double \\nharness?\"  \\nWell, he did look so good humoured and so jolly that it didn\\'t seem half so \\nhard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Sewa rd. So I said, as lig htly as I could, that \\nI did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn\\'t broken to harness at all \\nyet. Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he \\nhad made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, and occasion for \\nhim, I would forgive him. He really did lo ok serious when he was saying it, and \\nI couldn\\'t help feeling a sort of exu ltation that he was number Two in one day. \\nAnd then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect \\ntorrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so \\nearnest over it that I shall never again th ink that a man must be playful always, \\nand never earnest, because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in \\nmy face which checked him, for he sudde nly stopped, and said with a sort of \\nmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free  \\n\"Lucy, you are an honest hearted girl, I know. I sh ould not be here \\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you cl ean grit, right through to \\nthe very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I\\'ll never tr ouble you a hair\\'s \\nbreadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.\"  \\nMy dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy \\nof them? Here was I almost making fun of  this great hearted, true gentleman. I \\nburst into tears, I am afraid, my dear, yo u will think this a very sloppy letter in \\nmore ways than one, and I really felt very badly.  \\nWhy can\\'t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save \\nall this trouble? But this is  heresy, and I must not say it. I am glad to say that, \\nthough I was crying, I was able to look in to Mr. Morris\\' brave eyes, and I told \\nhim out straight  \\n\"Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even \\nloves me.\" I was right to speak to him so  frankly, for quite a light came into his \\nface, and he put out both his hands and took mine, I think I put them into his, \\nand said in a hearty way  \\n\"That\\'s my brave girl. It\\'s better wor th being late for a chance of winning \\nyou than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don\\'t cry, my dear. If it\\'s \\nfor me, I\\'m a hard nut to crack, and I ta ke it standing up. If that other fellow \\ndoesn\\'t know his happiness, well, he\\'d better look for it soon, or he\\'ll have to deal with me. Little girl, your honesty and pluck have  made me a friend, and \\nthat\\'s rarer than a lover, it\\'s more selfis h anyhow. My dear, I\\'m going to have a \\npretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won\\'t you give me one \\nkiss? It\\'ll be something to keep of f the darkness now and then. You can, you \\nknow, if you like, for that o ther good fellow, or you cou ld not love him, hasn\\'t \\nspoken yet.\"  \\nThat quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and noble too, \\nto a rival, wasn\\'t it? And he so sad, so I leant over and kissed him.  \\nHe stood up with my two hands in his, and as he lo oked down into my face, \\nI am afraid I was blushing very much, he said, \"Li ttle girl, I hold your hand, \\nand you\\'ve kissed me, and if these things  don\\'t make us fr iends nothing ever \\nwill. Thank you for your sweet ho nesty to me, and goodbye.\"  \\nHe wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room \\nwithout looking back , without a tear or a quiver or  a pause, and I am crying like \\na baby.  \\nOh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls \\nabout who would worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were \\nfree, only I don\\'t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I \\ncannot write of happiness just at once, af ter telling you of it, and I don\\'t wish to \\ntell of the number Three until it can be all happy. Ever your loving  \\nLucy  \\nP.S.--Oh, about number Three, I needn\\'t tell you of number Three, need I? \\nBesides, it was all so confused. It s eemed only a moment from his coming into \\nthe room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me. I am very, \\nvery happy, and I don\\'t know what I have done to deserve it. I must only try in \\nthe future to show that I am not ungrat eful to God for all His goodness to me in \\nsending to me such a lover, such  a husband, and such a friend.  \\nGoodbye.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY (Kept in phonograph)  25 May.--Ebb tide in appetite today.  Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary \\ninstead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I ha ve a sort of empty feeling. Nothing in \\nthe world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing. As I knew that \\nthe only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went amongst the patients. I \\npicked out one who has afforded me a stu dy of much interest. He is so quaint \\nthat I am determined to understand him as well as I can. Today I seemed to get \\nnearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.  \\nI questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making \\nmyself master of the facts of his hall ucination. In my manner of doing it there \\nwas, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep him to the point \\nof his madness, a thing which I avoid with  the patients as I would the mouth of \\nhell.  \\n(Mem., Under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell?) \\nOmnia Romae venalia sunt. Hell has its pr ice! If there be anything behind this \\ninstinct it will be valuable to trace it af terwards accurately, so I had better \\ncommence to do so, therefore  \\nR. M, Renfield, age 59. Sanguine te mperament, great physical strength, \\nmorbidly excitable, periods of gloom, e nding in some fixed idea which I cannot \\nmake out. I presume that th e sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing \\ninfluence end in a mentally-accomplished finish, a possibly dangerous man, \\nprobably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution is as secure an armour \\nfor their foes as for themselves. What I think of on this point is, when self is the \\nfixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal. When duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or \\na series of accidents can balance it.  \\nLETTER, QUINCEY P. MORRIS TO  HON. ARTHUR HOLMOOD  \\n25 May.  My dear Art,  \\nWe\\'ve told yarns by the campfire in the prairies, and dressed one another\\'s \\nwounds after trying a landing at the Ma rquesas, and drunk healths on the shore \\nof Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and other woun ds to be healed, \\nand another health to be drunk. Won\\'t you le t this be at my campfire tomorrow \\nnight? I have no hesitation in  asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner party, and that you are free. There will only be one other, our \\nold pal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He\\'s  coming, too, and we both want to \\nmingle our weeps over the wine cup, and to  drink a health with all our hearts to \\nthe happiest man in all the wide world,  who has won the noblest heart that God \\nhas made and best worth winning. We  promise you a hearty welcome, and a \\nloving greeting, and a heal th as true as your own right hand.

I bear messa ges which will make both your ears \\ntingle.  \\nArt  \\nCHAPTER 6  \\nMINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL  \\n24 July. Whitby.--Luc\\ny met me at the station, looking sweet er and lovelier \\nthan ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little  river, the Esk, runs through a deep \\nvalley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great viaduct runs \\nacross, with high piers,  through which the view s eems somehow further away \\nthan it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you lo ok right across it, unless you are near \\nenough to see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us, are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one ove r the other anyhow, like the pictures we \\nsee of Nuremberg. Right over the town is  the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was \\nsacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of \"Marmion,\" where the \\ngirl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of \\nbeautiful and romantic bits. There is a lege nd that a white lady is seen in one of \\nthe windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, \\nround which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the \\nnicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the  town, and has a full view of the \\nharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out \\ninto the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has \\nfallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed.  \\nIn one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the \\nsandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard, and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful \\nview and enjoying the breeze.  \\nI shall come and sit here often myself  and work. Indeed, I am writing now, \\nwith my book on my knee, and listening to  the talk of three old men who are \\nsitting beside me. They seem to do noth ing all day but sit here and talk.  \\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall \\nstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle \\nof which is a lighthouse. A heavy seawall runs along outside of it. On the near \\nside, the seawall makes an elbow croo ked inversely, and its end too has a \\nlighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, \\nwhich then suddenly widens.  \\nIt is nice at high water, but when the tide  is out it shoals away to nothing, \\nand there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between ba nks of sand, with \\nrocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there ri ses for about half \\na mile a great reef, the sharp of which runs straight out from behind the south \\nlighthouse. At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which sw ings in bad weather, \\nand sends in a mournful sound on the wind.  \\nThey have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I \\nmust ask the old man about this. He is coming this way  \\nHe is a funny old man. He must be aw fully old, for his face is gnarled and \\ntwisted like the bark of a tree. He tells  me that he is nearly a hundred, and that \\nhe was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea \\nand the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely,  \\n\"I wouldn\\'t fash masel\\' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out. \\nMind, I don\\'t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn\\'t in my time. \\nThey be all very well for comers and trippers, an\\' the like, but not for a nice \\nyoung lady like you. Them feet-folks fr om York and Leeds that be always \\neatin\\' cured herrin\\'s and drinkin\\' tea an \\' lookin\\' out to buy cheap jet would creed \\naught. I wonder masel\\' who\\'d be bothered tellin\\' lies to them, even the \\nnewspapers, which is full of fool-talk.\"  \\nI thought he would be a good person to le arn interesting things from, so I \\nasked him if he would mind telling me  something about the whale fishing in \\nthe old days. He was just settling himself  to begin when the clock struck six, \\nwhereupon he laboured to get up, and said,  \\n\"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn\\'t \\nlike to be kept waitin\\' when the tea is  ready, for it takes me time to crammle \\naboon the grees, for there be a many of \\'e m, and miss, I lack belly-timber sairly \\nby the clock.\"  \\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down \\nthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from the town to \\nthe church, there are hundreds of the m, I do not know how many, and they \\nwind up in a delicate curve. The slope is so gentle that a horse could easily \\nwalk up and down them.  \\nI think they must originally have ha d something to do with the abbey. I \\nshall go home too. Lucy went out, visiting  with her mother, and as they were \\nonly duty calls, I did not go.  \\n1 August.--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most \\ninteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and \\njoin him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have \\nbeen in his time a most dictatorial person.  \\nHe will not admit anything, and down  faces everybody. If he can\\'t out-\\nargue them he bullies them,  and then takes their sile nce for agreement with his \\nviews.  Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock. She has got a \\nbeautiful colour since she has been here.  \\nI noticed that the old men did not lose  any time in coming and sitting near \\nher when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people, I think they all fell in \\nlove with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict \\nher, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, \\nand he went off at once into a sort of se rmon. I must try to remember it and put \\nit down.  \\n\"It be all fool-talk, lock , stock, and barrel, that\\'s what it be and nowt else. \\nThese bans an\\' wafts an\\' boh-ghosts an\\' bar-guests an\\' bogles an\\' all anent them \\nis only fit to set bairns an\\' dizzy women a\\'belderin\\'. They be nowt but air-blebs. \\nThey, an\\' all grims an\\' signs an\\' warnin\\'s,  be all invented by parsons an\\' illsome \\nberk-bodies an\\' railway touters to skeer an\\' scunner hafflin\\'s, an\\' to get folks to \\ndo somethin\\' that they don\\'t other incline to . It makes me ireful to think o\\' them. \\nWhy, it\\'s them that, not content with printin\\' lies on paper an\\' preachin\\' them \\nout of pulpits, does want to be cuttin \\' them on the tombstones. Look here all \\naround you in what airt ye will. All the m steans, holdin\\' up their heads as well \\nas they can out of their pride, is acant,  simply tumblin\\' down with the weight o\\' \\nthe lies wrote on them, \\'Here lies the bo dy\\' or \\'Sacred to the memory\\' wrote on \\nall of them, an\\' yet in nigh half of them there bean\\'t no bodies at all, an\\' the memories of them bean\\'t cared a pinch of  snuff about, much less sacred. Lies \\nall of them, nothin\\' but lies of one kind or another! My gog, but it\\'ll be a quare \\nscowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin\\' up in their \\ndeath-sarks, all jouped together an\\' tr ying\\' to drag their tombsteans with them to \\nprove how good they was, some of them trimmlin\\' an\\' dithering, with their \\nhands that dozzened an\\' slippery from lyin\\' in the sea that they can\\'t even keep \\ntheir gurp o\\' them.\"  \\nI could see from the old fellow\\'s self-s atisfied air and the way in which he \\nlooked round for the approval of his cronie s that he was \"showing off,\" so I put \\nin a word to keep him going.  \\n\"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can\\'t be seriou s. Surely these tombstones are not all \\nwrong?\"  \\n\"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin\\' where they make \\nout the people too good, for there be folk that  do think a balm-b owl be like the \\nsea, if only it be their own. The whole  thing be only lies.  Now look you here. \\nYou come here a stranger, an\\' you see this kirkgarth.\"  I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite understand \\nhis dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.  \\nHe went on, \"And you consate that all th ese steans be aboon folk that be \\nhaped here, snod an\\' snog?\" I assented ag ain. \"Then that be just where the lie \\ncomes in. Why, there be scores of the se laybeds that be toom as old Dun\\'s \\n\\'baccabox on Friday night.\"  \\nHe nudged one of his companions, an d they all laughed. \"And, my gog! \\nHow could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank, \\nread it!\"  \\nI went over and read, \"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by \\npirates off the coast of Andres, April,  1854, age 30.\" When I came back Mr. \\nSwales went on,  \\n\"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the \\ncoast of Andres! An\\' you consated his b ody lay under! Why, I could name ye a \\ndozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above,\" he po inted northwards, \\n\"or where the currants may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. \\nYe can, with your young eyes, read the sm all print of the lies from here. This \\nBraithwaite Lowery, I knew his father, los t in the Lively off Greenland in \\'20, \\nor Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the sa me seas in 1777, or John Paxton, \\ndrowned off Cape Farewell a year la ter, or old John Rawlings, whose \\ngrandfather sailed with me, drowned in th e Gulf of Finland in \\'50. Do ye think \\nthat all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet \\nsounds? I have me antherums aboot it! I te ll ye that when they got here they\\'d \\nbe jommlin\\' and jostlin\\' one another that wa y that it \\'ud be like a fight up on the \\nice in the old days, when we\\'d be at one another from daylight to dark, an\\' tryin\\' \\nto tie up our cuts by the aurora boreali s.\" This was evidentl y local pleasantry, \\nfor the old man cackled over it, and hi s cronies joined in with gusto.  \\n\"But,\" I said, \"surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the \\nassumption that all the poor people, or  their spirits, will have to take their \\ntombstones with them on the Day of Judgme nt. Do you think that will be really \\nnecessary?\"  \\n\"Well, what else be they tombstone s for? Answer me that, miss!\"  \\n\"To please their relati ves, I suppose.\"  \"To please their relatives, you suppose! \" This he said with intense scorn. \\n\"How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them, and \\nthat everybody in the  place knows that they be lies?\"  \\nHe pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on \\nwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge  of the cliff. \"Read the lies on that \\nthruff-stone,\" he said.  \\nThe letters were upside down to me fr om where I sat, but Lucy was more \\nopposite to them, so she leant over and read, \"Sacred to the memory of George \\nCanon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurre ction, on July 29, 1873, \\nfalling from the rocks at Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing \\nmother to her dearly beloved son. \\'He was the only son of his mother, and she \\nwas a widow.\\' Really, Mr. Swales, I don\\'t see anything very funny in that!\" She \\nspoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.  \\n\"Ye don\\'t see aught funny! Ha-ha! But that\\'s because ye don\\'t gawm the \\nsorrowin\\' mother was a hell-cat that ha ted him because he was acrewk\\'d, a \\nregular lamiter he was, an\\' he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn\\'t get an insurance she put on his life. He ble w nigh the top of \\nhis head off with an old musket that they had for scarin\\' crows with. \\'Twarn\\'t \\nfor crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That\\'s the way he fell off the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I\\'ve often heard \\nhim say masel\\' that he hoped he\\'d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that \\nshe\\'d be sure to go to heaven, an\\' he didn\\'t want to addle where she was. Now \\nisn\\'t that stean at any rate,\" he hammered  it with his stick as he spoke, \"a pack \\nof lies? And won\\'t it make Gabriel kec kle when Geordie comes pantin\\' ut the \\ngrees with the tompstean balanced on  his hump, and asks  to be took as \\nevidence!\"  \\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she said, \\nrising up, \"Oh, why did you te ll us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot \\nleave it, and now I find I must go on si tting over the grave of a suicide.\"  \\n\"That won\\'t harm ye, my pretty, an\\' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to \\nhave so trim a lass sittin\\' on his lap. Th at won\\'t hurt ye. Why, I\\'ve sat here off \\nan\\' on for nigh twenty years past, an\\' it hasn\\'t done me no harm. Don\\'t ye fash \\nabout them as lies under ye, or that doesn\\'  lie there either! It\\'ll be time for ye to \\nbe getting scart when ye see the tombst eans all run away w ith, and the place as \\nbare as a stubble-field. There\\'s the cloc k, and I must gang. My service to ye, \\nladies!\" And off he hobbled.  Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we took \\nhands as we sat, and she told me all ov er again about Arthur and their coming \\nmarriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven\\'t heard from \\nJonathan for a whole month.  \\nThe same day. I came up here alone, fo r I am very sad. There was no letter \\nfor me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan. The clock has \\njust struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the town, sometimes in rows \\nwhere the streets are, and sometimes si ngly. They run rig ht up the Esk and die \\naway in the curve of the valley. To my le ft the view is cut off by a black line of \\nroof of the old house next to the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the \\nfields away behind me, and there is a clatter of donkeys\\' hoofs up the paved \\nroad below. The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and \\nfurther along the quay there is a Sa lvation Army meeting in a back street. \\nNeither of the bands hears the other, bu t up here I hear and see them both. I \\nwonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he were here.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n5 June.--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to \\nunderstand the man. He has certain qualitie s very largely developed, selfishness, \\nsecrecy, and purpose.  \\nI wish I could get at what is the object of the latter. He seems to have some \\nsettled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not know. His redeeming quality \\nis a love of animals, though, indeed, he  has such curious turns in it that I \\nsometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd sorts.  \\nJust now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a quantity that \\nI have had myself to expostulate. To my  astonishment, he did not break out into \\na fury, as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousn ess. He thought for \\na moment, and then said, \"May I have th ree days? I shall clear them away.\" Of \\ncourse, I said that would do. I must watch him.  \\n18 June.--He has turned his mind now to spiders, an d has got several very \\nbig fellows in a box. He keeps feeding th em his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, al though he has used half his food in \\nattracting more flies fr om outside to his room.  \\n1 July.--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies, and \\ntoday I told him that he must get rid of them.  \\nHe looked very sad at this, so I said that he must some of them, at all \\nevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this , and I gave him the same time as \\nbefore for reduction.  \\nHe disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blowfly, bloated \\nwith some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly \\nfor a few moments between his finger a nd thumb, and before I knew what he \\nwas going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it.  \\nI scolded him for it, but he argued qu ietly that it was very good and very \\nwholesome, that it was life, strong life, a nd gave life to him. This gave me an \\nidea, or the rudiment of one. I must watc h how he gets rid of his spiders.  \\nHe has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little \\nnotebook in which he is al ways jotting down something.  Whole pages of it are \\nfilled with masses of figures, generall y single numbers added up in batches, \\nand then the totals added in batches agai n, as though he were focussing some \\naccount, as the auditors put it.  \\n8 July.--There is a method in his ma dness, and the rudimentary idea in my \\nmind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, an d then, oh, unconscious \\ncerebration, you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother.  \\nI kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there \\nwere any change. Things remain as they were except that he has parted with \\nsome of his pets and got a new one.  \\nHe has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His \\nmeans of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that \\ndo remain, however, are well fed, for he  still brings in the flies by tempting \\nthem with his food.  19 July--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of \\nsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came in he \\nran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour, a very, very great favour. \\nAnd as he spoke, he fawned on me like a dog.  \\nI asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and \\nbearing, \"A kitten, a nice, little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and \\nteach, and feed, and feed, and feed!\"  \\nI was not unprepared for this request, fo r I had noticed how his pets went \\non increasing in size and vivacity, but I di d not care that his pretty family of \\ntame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders. \\nSo I said I would see abo ut it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat \\nthan a kitten.  \\nHis eagerness betrayed him as he answer ed, \"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I \\nonly asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me \\na kitten, would they?\"  \\nI shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, \\nbut that I would see about it.  His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger \\nin it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing. The man \\nis an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him with his present craving \\nand see how it will work out, then I shall know more.  \\n10 pm.--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner \\nbrooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat, that his salvation depended upon it.  \\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon he \\nwent without a word, and sat down, gnaw ing his fingers, in the corner where I \\nhad found him. I shall see him in the morning early.  \\n20 July.--Visited Renfield very early,  before attendant went his rounds. \\nFound him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar, which he \\nhad saved, in the window, and was manifes tly beginning his fly catching again, \\nand beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace.  I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they \\nwere. He replied, without turning round,  that they had all flown away. There \\nwere a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said \\nnothing, but went and told the  keeper to report to me if there were anything odd \\nabout him during the day.  \\n11 am.--The attendant has just been to see me to say that Renfield has been \\nvery sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. \"My belief is, doctor,\" he \\nsaid, \"that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!\"  \\n11 pm.--I gave Renfie ld a strong opiate tonight, enough to make even him \\nsleep, and took away his pocketbook to look at it. The thought that has been \\nbuzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved.  \\nMy homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to invent a new \\nclassification for him, and call him a zoophagous (life-eating) maniac. What he \\ndesires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to \\nachieve it in a cumulative way. He gave many flies to one spider and many \\nspiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would \\nhave been his later steps?  \\nIt would almost be worth while to co mplete the experiment. It might be \\ndone if there were only a sufficient cause.  Men sneered at vivisection, and yet \\nlook at its results today! Why not advanc e science in its most  difficult and vital \\naspect, the knowledge of the brain?  \\nHad I even the secret of one such mind, did I hold the key to the fancy of \\neven one lunatic, I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch \\ncompared with which Burdon-Sanders on\\'s physiology or Ferrier\\'s brain \\nknowledge would be as noth ing. If only there were a sufficient cause! I must \\nnot think too much of this, or I may be  tempted. A good cause might turn the \\nscale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?  \\nHow well the man reasoned. Lunatics al ways do within their own scope. I \\nwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately, and today begun a new record . How many of us begin \\na new record with each day of our lives?  To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, \\nand that truly I began a new record. So it shall be until the Great Recorder sums \\nme up and closes my ledger account wi th a balance to profit or loss.  \\nOh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my \\nfriend whose happiness is yours, but I must only wait on hopeless and work. \\nWork! Work!  \\nIf I could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there, a good, \\nunselfish cause to make me work, that would be indeed happiness.  \\nMINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL  26 July.--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here. It is like \\nwhispering to one\\'s self a nd listening at the same time. And there is also \\nsomething about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I \\nam unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan . I had not heard from Jonathan for \\nsome time, and was very concerned, b ut yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is \\nalways so kind, sent me a letter from him. I had written asking him if he had \\nheard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated \\nfrom Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home . That is not like \\nJonathan. I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy.  \\nThen, too, Lucy, although she is so we ll, has lately taken to her old habit \\nof walking in her sleep. Her mother ha s spoken to me about it, and we have \\ndecided that I am to lock the doo r of our room every night.  \\nMrs. Westenra has got an idea that sl eep-walkers always go out on roofs of \\nhouses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall \\nover with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place.  \\nPoor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her \\nhusband, Lucy\\'s father, had the same ha bit, that he would get up in the night \\nand dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped.  \\nLucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her \\ndresses and how her house is to be arra nged. I sympathise with her, for I do the \\nsame, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have \\nto try to make both ends meet.  Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord \\nGodalming, is coming up here very shortly, as soon as he can leave town, for \\nhis father is not very well, and I think dear  Lucy is counting the moments till he \\ncomes.  \\nShe wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him \\nthe beauty of Whitby. I dare say it is the waiting whic h disturbs her. She will be \\nall right when he arrives.  \\n27 July.--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him, \\nthough why I should I do not know, but I do wish that he would write, if it were \\nonly a single line.  \\nLucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving \\nabout the room. Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold. But \\nstill, the anxiety and the pe rpetually being awakened is beginning to tell on me, \\nand I am getting nervous and wakeful my self. Thank God, Lucy\\'s health keeps \\nup. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly calle d to Ring to see his father, who has \\nbeen taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postpon ement of seeing him, but it \\ndoes not touch her looks. She is a trifle  stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely \\nrose-pink. She has lost the anemic look wh ich she had. I pray it will all last.  \\n3 August.--Another week go ne by, and no news from  Jonathan, not even to \\nMr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely \\nwould have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, a nd yet it is his writing. There is no \\nmistake of that.  \\nLucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd \\nconcentration about her w hich I do not understand, ev en in her sleep she seems \\nto be watching me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the \\nroom searching for the key.  \\n6 August.--Another three days, and no  news. This suspense is getting \\ndreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier. But no one has heard a word of Jonathan si nce that last letter. I must only pray \\nto God for patience.  \\nLucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was \\nvery threatening, and the fishermen say tha t we are in for a storm. I must try to \\nwatch it and learn the weather signs.  \\nToday is a gray day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high \\nover Kettleness. Everything is gray ex cept the green grass, which seems like \\nemerald amongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds, tinged with the sunburst at \\nthe far edge, hang over the gray sea, into  which the sandpoints stretch like gray \\nfigures. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, \\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a gray mist. All vastness, the clouds are piled up like giant  rocks, and there is a \\'brool\\' over the \\nsea that sounds like some passage of d oom. Dark figures are on the beach here \\nand there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem \\'men like trees walking\\'. The fishing boats are racing fo r home, and rise a nd dip in the ground \\nswell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old \\nMr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his \\nhat, that he wants to talk.  \\nI have been quite touched by the change  in the poor old man. When he sat \\ndown beside me, he said in a very gentle  way, \"I want to say something to you, \\nmiss.\"  \\nI could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine \\nand asked him to speak fully.  \\nSo he said, leaving his hand in mine, \"I\\'m afraid, my deary, that I must \\nhave shocked you by all the wicked things I\\'ve been sayin\\' about the dead, and \\nsuch like, for weeks past, but I didn\\'t mean them, and I want ye to remember \\nthat when I\\'m gone. We aud folks that be  daffled, and with one foot abaft the \\nkrok-hooal, don\\'t altogether l ike to think of it, and we don\\'t want to feel scart of \\nit, and that\\'s why I\\'ve took to makin\\' light of it, so that I\\'d cheer up my own \\nheart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain\\'t afraid of dyin\\', not a bit, only I don\\'t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and \\na hundred years is too much for any ma n to expect. And I\\'m so nigh it that the \\nAud Man is already whettin\\' his scythe. Ye see, I can\\'t get out o\\' the habit of \\ncaffin\\' about it all at once. The chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day \\nsoon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don\\'t ye dooal an\\' greet, my deary!\"--for he saw that I was crying--\"if he should come this very \\nnight I\\'d not refuse to answer his call. Fo r life be, after all, only a waitin\\' for somethin\\' else than what we\\'re doin\\', and death be all that we can rightly \\ndepend on. But I\\'m content, for it\\'s com in\\' to me, my deary, and comin\\' quick. \\nIt may be comin\\' while we be lookin\\' and wonderin\\'. Maybe it\\'s in that wind out \\nover the sea that\\'s bringin\\' with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad \\nhearts. Look! Look!\" he cried suddenly. \"T here\\'s something in that wind and in \\nthe hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and sm ells like death. It\\'s in \\nthe air. I feel it comin\\'. Lord, make me answer cheerful, when my call comes!\" \\nHe held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes\\' s ilence, he got up, sh ook hands with me, \\nand blessed me, and said goodbye, and ho bbled off. It all touched me, and \\nupset me very much.  \\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spyg lass under his \\narm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept \\nlooking at a strange ship.  \\n\"I can\\'t make her out,\" he said. \"She\\'s a Russian, by the look of her. But \\nshe\\'s knocking about in the queerest way.  She doesn\\'t know her mind a bit. She \\nseems to see the storm coming, but can\\'t decide whether to run up north in the \\nopen, or to put in here. Look there again! She is steered mighty strangely, for \\nshe doesn\\'t mind the hand on the wheel, changes about with every puff of wind. We\\'ll hear more of her before this time tomorrow.\"  \\nCHAPTER 7  \\nCUTTING FROM \"THE DAILYGRAPH\", 8 AUGUST  \\n(PASTED IN MINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL)  \\nFrom\\n a correspondent.  \\nWhitby.  \\nOne of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been \\nexperienced here, with results both stra nge and unique. The weather had been \\nsomewhat sultry, but not to any degr ee uncommon in the month of August. \\nSaturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the  great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for vis its to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood\\'s \\nBay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and th e various trips in the neighborhood of \\nWhitby. The steamers Emma and Scar borough made trips up and down the \\ncoast, and there was an unusual amount of \\'tripping\\' both to and from Whitby. \\nThe day was unusually fine till the afte rnoon, when some of the gossips who \\nfrequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from the commanding eminence watch \\nthe wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden \\nshow of \\'mares tails\\' high in the sk y to the northwest. The wind was then \\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language \\nis ranked \\'No. 2, light breeze.\\'  \\nThe coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who \\nfor more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East \\nCliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautif ul, so grand in its masses of splendidly \\ncoloured clouds, that there was quite an  assemblage on the walk along the cliff \\nin the old churchyard to enjoy the beau ty. Before the sun dipped below the \\nblack mass of Kettleness, standing bo ldly athwart the we stern sky, its \\ndownward way was marked by myriad clou ds of every sunset colour, flame, \\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the ti nts of gold, with here and there masses \\nnot large, but of seemingly absolute blackn ess, in all sorts of shapes, as well \\noutlined as colossal silhou ettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, \\nand doubtless some of the sketches of the \\'Prelude to the Great Storm\\' will \\ngrace the R. A and R. I. walls in May next.  \\nMore than one captain made up his mind then and there that his \\'cobble\\' or \\nhis \\'mule\\', as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the \\nevening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that \\nprevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunde r, affects persons of a \\nsensitive nature.  \\nThere were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, \\nwhich usually hug the shor e so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few \\nfishing boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner \\nwith all sails set, which was seemingly go ing westwards. The foolhardiness or \\nignorance of her officers was a prolific  theme for comment whilst she remained \\nin sight, and efforts were made to signal  her to reduce sail in the face of her \\ndanger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails id ly flapping as she \\ngently rolled on the undula ting swell of the sea.  \\n\"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\"  Shortly before ten o\\'clock the stillness of the air gr ew quite oppressive, and \\nthe silence was so marked that the bleati ng of a sheep inland or  the barking of a \\ndog in the town was distinctl y heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively \\nFrench air, was like a dischord in the great harmony of nature\\'s silence. A little \\nafter midnight came a strange sound from  over the sea, and high overhead the \\nair began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.  \\nThen without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the \\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwar ds is impossible to realize, the whole \\naspect of nature at once became convul sed. The waves rose in growing fury, \\neach over-topping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was \\nlike a roaring and devouring monster. White-crested  waves beat madly on the \\nlevel sands and rushed up the shelving cl iffs. Others broke over the piers, and \\nwith their spume swept the la nthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end \\nof either pier of Whitby Harbour.  \\nThe wind roared like thunder, and ble w with such force that it was with \\ndifficulty that even strong men kept thei r feet, or clung with grim clasp to the \\niron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of \\nonlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have in creased manifold. To \\nadd to the difficulties and dangers of the  time, masses of sea-fog came drifting \\ninland. White, wet clouds, which sw ept by in ghostly fash ion, so dank and \\ndamp and cold that it needed but little  effort of imaginat ion to think that the \\nspirits of those lost at sea were touchin g their living brethren with the clammy \\nhands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by.  \\nAt times the mist cleared, and the s ea for some distance could be seen in \\nthe glare of the lightning, which came thick and fast, followed by such peals of \\nthunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the \\nfootsteps of the storm.  \\nSome of the scenes thus revealed we re of immeasurable grandeur and of \\nabsorbing interest. The sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each \\nwave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and \\nwhirl away into space. Here and there a fishing boat, with a rag of sail, running \\nmadly for shelter before the blast, now and again the white wings of a storm-\\ntossed seabird. On the summit of the Ea st Cliff the new searchlight was ready \\nfor experiment, but had not yet been trie d. The officers in charge of it got it into \\nworking order, and in the pauses of onrushing mist sw ept with it the surface of \\nthe sea. Once or twice its service was mo st effective, as when a fishing boat, \\nwith gunwale under water, ru shed into the harbour, able , by the guidance of the \\nsheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people \\non the shore, a shout which for a mome nt seemed to cleave the gale and was \\nthen swept away in its rush.  \\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner \\nwith all sails set, apparently the same ve ssel which had been noticed earlier in \\nthe evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a \\nshudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was.  \\nBetween her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good \\nships have from time to time suffered,  and, with the w ind blowing from its \\npresent quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance \\nof the harbour.  \\nIt was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in \\ntheir troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, \\nwith all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, \\n\"she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell\". Then came another rush \\nof sea-fog, greater than any hitherto, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to \\nclose on all things like a gray pall, and left availabl e to men only the organ of \\nhearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through  the damp oblivion even louder \\nthan before. The rays of the searchligh t were kept fixed on the harbour mouth \\nacross the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless.  \\nThe wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the remnant of the sea fog \\nmelted in the blast. And then, mirabile dic tu, between the piers, leaping from \\nwave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before \\nthe blast, with all sail set, and gained th e safety of the harbour. The searchlight \\nfollowed her, and a shudder ran through al l who saw her, for lashed to the helm \\nwas a corpse, with drooping head, w hich swung horribly to and fro at each \\nmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on the deck at all.  \\nA great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, \\nhad found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However, all \\ntook place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner \\npaused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that \\naccumulation of sand and gravel washed  by many tides and many storms into \\nthe southeast corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as \\nTate Hill Pier.  There was of course a considerable co ncussion as the vessel drove up on \\nthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay  was strained, and some of the \\'top-\\nhammer\\' came crashing down. But, stranges t of all, the very instant the shore \\nwas touched, an immense dog sprang up on  deck from below, as if shot up by \\nthe concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand.  \\nMaking straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the \\nlaneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones, \\nthruffsteans or through-stones, as the y call them in Whitby vernacular, actually \\nproject over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the \\ndarkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.  \\nIt so happened that there was no one at  the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all \\nthose whose houses are in c lose proximity were either in bed or were out on the \\nheights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, \\nwho at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb aboard. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turne d the light on the derelict  and kept it there. The \\ncoastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though unde r some sudden emotion. This seemed to \\npique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run.  \\nIt is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-bridge to Tate Hill \\nPier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the \\ncrowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a \\ncrowd, whom the coastguard and poli ce refused to allow to come on board. By \\nthe courtesy of the chief boatman, I was,  as your correspon dent, permitted to \\nclimb on deck, and was one of a small gr oup who saw the dead seaman whilst \\nactually lashed to the wheel.  \\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard wa s surprised, or even awed, for not \\noften can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a sp oke of the wheel. Between the inner hand \\nand the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept  fast by the bindin g cords. The poor \\nfellow may have been seated at one tim e, but the flapping and buffeting of the \\nsails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and had dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he wa s tied had cut the flesh to the bone.  \\nAccurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor, Surgeon J. M. \\nCaffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place, w ho came immediately after me, declared, \\nafter making examination, that the man must  have been dead for quite two days.  In his pocket was a bottle, carefully co rked, empty save for a little roll of \\npaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log.  \\nThe coastguard said the man must have  tied up his own hands, fastening \\nthe knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may \\nsave some complications later on, in the Admiralty Court, for coastguards \\ncannot claim the salvage which is the ri ght of the first ci vilian entering on a \\nderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law \\nstudent is loudly asserting that the rights of the ow ner are already completely \\nsacrificed, his property being held in co ntravention of the statues of mortmain, \\nsince the tiller, as emblemship, if not pr oof, of delegated possession, is held in \\na dead hand.  \\nIt is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed \\nfrom the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death, a \\nsteadfastness as noble as that of the  young Casabianca, and placed in the \\nmortuary to await inquest.  \\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating. Crowds \\nare scattering backward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire \\nwolds.  \\nI shall send, in time for your next issue,  further details of the derelict ship \\nwhich found her way so miracul ously into harbour in the storm.  \\n9 August.--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last \\nnight is almost more startlin g than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner \\nis Russian from Varna, and is called the  Demeter. She is almost entirely in \\nballast of silver sand, with only a sm all amount of cargo, a number of great \\nwooden boxes filled  with mould.  \\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S.F. Billington, of 7, \\nThe Crescent, who this morning went aboard and took formal possession of the \\ngoods consigned to him.  \\nThe Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal \\npossession of the ship, and pa id all harbour dues, etc.  \\nNothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence. The \\nofficials of the Board of Trade have be en most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a \\n\\'nine days wonder\\', they are evidently de termined that there shall be no cause \\nof other complaint.  \\nA good deal of interest was abroad co ncerning the dog which landed when \\nthe ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S.P.C.A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general \\ndisappointment, however, it was not to be  found. It seems to have disappeared \\nentirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to \\nthe moors, where it is still hiding in terror.  \\nThere are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it \\nshould in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this \\nmorning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to \\nTate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite its master\\'s yard. It had \\nbeen fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn \\naway, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.  \\nLater.--By the kindness of the Boar d of Trade inspector, I have been \\npermitted to look over the log book of the Demeter, which was in order up to \\nwithin three days, but containe d nothing of special interest except as to facts of \\nmissing men. The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was today produced at the inquest. And a more strange \\nnarrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across.  \\nAs there is no motive for concealm ent, I am permitted to use them, and \\naccordingly send you a transcript, simply omitting technical details of \\nseamanship and supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that \\nthis had developed persiste ntly throughout the voyage. Of course my statement \\nmust be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the \\nRussian consul, who kindly translat ed for me, time being short.  \\nLOG OF THE \"DEMETER\" Varna to Whitby \\nWritten 18 July, things so stra nge happening, that I shall \\nkeep accurate note henceforth till we land.  \\nOn 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes \\nof earth. At noon set sail. Ea st wind, fresh. Crew, five \\nhands two mates, cook, and myself, (captain). \\nOn 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish \\nCustoms officers. Backsheesh . All correct. Under way at \\n4 p.m.  \\nOn 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and \\nflagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of \\nofficers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon. At dark \\npassed into Archipelago.  \\nOn 13 July passed Cape Matapa n. Crew dissatisfied about \\nsomething. Seemed scared, but would not speak out.  \\nOn 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady \\nfellows, who sailed with me before . Mate could not make out what \\nwas wrong. They only told him there was SOMETHING, and crossed \\nthemselves. Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet. \\nOn 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of the \\ncrew, Petrofsky, was missing. Could not account for it. \\nTook larboard watch eight bells last night, was relieved by \\nAmramoff, but did not go to bu nk. Men more downcast than \\never. All said they expected  something of the kind, but \\nwould not say more than there was SOMETHING aboard. Mate getting very impatient with them. Feared some trouble \\nahead.  \\nOn 17 July, yesterday, one of the  men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, \\nand in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a \\nstrange man aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had \\nbeen sheltering behind the deckhous e, as there was a rain storm, \\nwhen he saw a tall, thin man, w ho was not like any of the crew, \\ncome up the companionway, and go along the deck forward and disappear. He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found \\nno one, and the hatchways were all closed. He was in a panic of \\nsuperstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, I shall today search the entire ship carefully from stem \\nto stern. \\nLater in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as \\nthey evidently thought there was so me one in the ship, we would \\nsearch from stem to stern. First mate angry, said it was folly, \\nand to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men, said \\nhe would engage to keep them out of trouble with the handspike. I \\nlet him take the helm, while the rest began a thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns. We  left no corner unsearched. As \\nthere were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners \\nwhere a man could hide. Men much relieved when search over, and \\nwent back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but said \\nnothing. \\n22 July.--Rough weather last thr ee days, and all hands busy \\nwith sails, no time to be frightened. Men seem to have \\nforgotten their dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on \\ngood terms. Praised men for wo rk in bad weather. Passed \\nGibraltar and out through Straits. All well. \\n24 July.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand \\nshort, and entering the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and \\nyet last night another man lost, dis appeared. Like the first, he \\ncame off his watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear, sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they \\nfear to be alone. Mate angry. Fear there will be some trouble, \\nas either he or the men will do some violence. \\n28 July.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of \\nmaelstrom, and the wind a te mpest. No sleep for any one. \\nMen all worn out. Hardly know  how to set a watch, since no \\none fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and \\nwatch, and let men snatch a few hours sleep. Wind abating, \\nseas still terrific, but f eel them less, as ship is \\nsteadier. \\n29 July.--Another tragedy. Had sin gle watch tonight, as crew too \\ntired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no \\none except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. \\nThorough search, but no one found.  Are now without second mate, \\nand crew in a panic. Mate and I ag reed to go armed henceforth and \\nwait for any sign of cause. \\n30 July.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather \\nfine, all sails set. Retired worn out, slept soundly, awakened by \\nmate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing. \\nOnly self and mate and tw o hands left to work ship. \\n1 August.--Two days of fog, a nd not a sail sighted. Had hoped \\nwhen in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get \\nin somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before \\nwind. Dare not lower, as could not raise them again. We seem to \\nbe drifting to some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature  seems to have worked inwardly \\nagainst himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are Russian, he \\nRoumanian. \\n2 August, midnight.--Woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a \\ncry, seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me he heard cry and ran, but \\nno sign of man on watch. One mo re gone. Lord, help us! Mate \\nsays we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just  as he heard the man cry out. \\nIf so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us, and God seems to have deserted us. \\n3 August.--At midnig ht I went to relieve the man at the \\nwheel and when I got to it f ound no one there. The wind \\nwas steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I \\ndared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few \\nseconds, he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked \\nwild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, \\nwith his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air \\nmight hear. \"It is here. I know it now. On the watch \\nlast night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind \\nIt, and gave it my knife, but the knife went through It, \\nempty as the air.\" And as he spoke he took the knife and drove it savagely into space. Th en he went on, \"But It is \\nhere, and I\\'ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one \\nof those boxes. I\\'ll unscrew them one by one and see. You \\nwork the helm.\" And with a wa rning look and his finger on \\nhis lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out \\non deck again with a tool ch est and lantern, and go down \\nthe forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and \\nit\\'s no use my trying to stop him. He can\\'t hurt those big \\nboxes, they are invoiced as cl ay, and to pull them about is \\nas harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay and mind \\nthe helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can\\'t steer to \\nany harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails, \\nand lie by, and signal for help \\nIt is nearly all over now. Ju st as I was beginning to hope \\nthat the mate would come out calmer, for I heard him \\nknocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him, there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled \\nscream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he \\ncame as if shot from a gun, a raging madman, with his eyes \\nrolling and his face convulsed with fear. \"Save me! Save me!\" he cried, and then looke d round on the blanket of fog. \\nHis horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he \\nsaid, \"You had better come too,  captain, before it is too \\nlate. He is there! I know the secret now. The sea will \\nsave me from Him, and it is all that is left!\" Before I \\ncould say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang \\non the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea. \\nI suppose I know the secret to o, now. It was this madman \\nwho had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has \\nfollowed them himself. God help me! How am I to account \\nfor all these horrors when I get to port? When I get to \\nport! Will that ever be? \\n4 August.--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce, I \\nknow there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I \\nknow not. I dared not go be low, I dared not leave the \\nhelm, so here all night I stay ed, and in the dimness of the \\nnight I saw it, Him! God, fo rgive me, but the mate was \\nright to jump overboard. It wa s better to die like a man. \\nTo die like a sailor in blue wa ter, no man can object. But \\nI am captain, and I must not leave my ship. But I shall \\nbaffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with \\nthem I shall tie that which He, It, dare not touch. And \\nthen, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my \\nhonour as a captain. I am gr owing weaker, and the night is \\ncoming on. If He can look me in the face again, I may not \\nhave time to act. . . If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle \\nmay be found, and those who find it may understand. If not well, then all men shall know that I have been \\ntrue to my trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the \\nSaints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty \\n Of course the verdict was an open one . There is no evidence to adduce, \\nand whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none \\nto say. The folk here hold almost universa lly that the captain is simply a hero, \\nand he is to be given a public funeral. Al ready it is arranged that his body is to \\nbe taken with a train of boats up the Es k for a piece and then brought back to \\nTate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps, fo r he is to be buried in the churchyard \\non the cliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in \\ntheir names as wishing to follow him to the grave.  \\nNo trace has ever been f ound of the great dog, at  which there is much \\nmourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I believe, be \\nadopted by the town. Tomorrow will see th e funeral, and so will end this one \\nmore \\'mystery of the sea\\'.  \\nMINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL  \\n8 August.--Lucy was very restless all ni ght, and I too, could not sleep. The \\nstorm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the chim ney pots, it made \\nme shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun. \\nStrangely enough, Lucy did not wake, but she got up twice and dressed herself. \\nFortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without \\nwaking her, and got her back  to bed. It is a very strange thing, this sleep-\\nwalking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any phys ical way, her intention, \\nif there be any, disappears, and she yiel ds herself almost exactly to the routine \\nof her life.  \\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see \\nif anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air cl ear and fresh, the big, grim-looking \\nwaves, that seemed dark themselves be cause the foam that topped them was \\nlike snow, forced themselves in throu gh the mouth of the harbour, like a \\nbullying man going th rough a crowd. Somehow I felt  glad that Jonathan was \\nnot on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, \\nand how? I am getting fearfully anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!  \\n10 August.--The funeral of the poor sea captain today was most touching. \\nEvery boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucy came with \\nme, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortege of boats went up the \\nriver to the Viaduct and came down agai n. We had a lovely view, and saw the \\nprocession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest near our seat so \\nthat we stood on it, when the time came and saw everything.  \\nPoor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the time, \\nand I cannot but think that he r dreaming at night is tell ing on her. She is quite \\nodd in one thing. She will not admit to  me that there is any cause for \\nrestlessness, or if there be, she does not understand it herself.  \\nThere is an additional cau se in that poor Mr. Swales was found dead this \\nmorning on our seat, his neck being br oken. He had evidently, as the doctor \\nsaid, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear \\nand horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old \\nman!  \\nLucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than \\nother people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not \\nmuch heed, though I am myself very fond of animals.  \\nOne of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed \\nby his dog. The dog is always with him.  They are both quiet persons, and I \\nnever saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog \\nwould not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards \\noff, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently,  and then harshly, and \\nthen angrily. But it would neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a \\nfury, with its eyes savage, and all its hair  bristling out like a cat\\'s tail when puss \\nis on the war path.  \\nFinally the man too got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and \\nthen took it by the scruff of the neck an d half dragged and ha lf threw it on the \\ntombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor \\nthing began to tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouc hed down, quivering \\nand cowering, and was in such a pitiable  state of terror that I tried, though \\nwithout effect, to comfort it.  \\nLucy was full of pity, too, but she d id not attempt to touch the dog, but \\nlooked at it in an agonised sort of wa y. I greatly fear that she is of too super \\nsensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be \\ndreaming of this tonight, I am sure. Th e whole agglomeratio n of things, the \\nship steered into port by a dead man, his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads, the touc hing funeral, the dog, now furious and now in terror, \\nwill all afford material for her dreams.  \\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physi cally, so I shall \\ntake her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood\\'s Bay and back. She ought \\nnot to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.  \\nCHAPTER 8  \\nMINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL  \\nSam\\ne day, 11 o\\'clock P.M.--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I had \\nmade my diary a duty I should not open it tonight. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, \\nafter a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came \\nnosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, a nd frightened the wits out \\nof us. I believe we forgot everything, ex cept of course, personal fear, and it \\nseemed to wipe the slate clean and give  us a fresh start. We had a capital \\n\\'severe tea\\' at Robin Hood\\'s Bay in a sw eet little old-fas hioned inn, with a bow \\nwindow right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we \\nshould have shocked the \\'New Woman\\'  with our appetites. Men are more \\ntolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full  of a constant dread of wild bulls.  \\nLucy was really tired, and we intende d to creep off to bed as soon as we \\ncould. The young curate came in, however , and Mrs. Westenra asked him to \\nstay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller. I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the \\nbishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, \\nwho don\\'t take supper, no matter how hard they may be pressed to, and who \\nwill know when girls are tired.  \\nLucy is asleep and breathing softly.  She has more colour in her cheeks \\nthan usual, and looks, oh so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her \\nseeing her only in the drawin g room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her \\nnow. Some of the \\'New Women\\' writers will some day start an idea that men \\nand women should be allowed to see eac h other asleep before proposing or \\naccepting. But I suppose the \\'New Woma n\\' won\\'t condesce nd in future to \\naccept. She will do the proposing herself.  And a nice job she will make of it \\ntoo! There\\'s some consolation in that. I am  so happy tonight, because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her \\ntroubles with dreaming. I should be quite  happy if I only knew if Jonathan \\nGod bless and keep him.  \\n11 August.--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write. I am too \\nagitated to sleep. We have had such  an adventure, such an agonizing \\nexperience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary. . . . Suddenly I \\nbecame broad awake, and sat up, with a ho rrible sense of fear upon me, and of \\nsome feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I could not see \\nLucy\\'s bed. I stole across and felt for her. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, \\nso threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the \\nroom it struck me that the clothes sh e wore might give me some clue to her \\ndreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house,  dress outside. \\nDressing-gown and dress were both in their places. \"Thank God,\" I said to \\nmyself, \"she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.\"  \\nI ran downstairs and looked in the sitt ing room. Not there! Then I looked \\nin all the other rooms of the house, with an  ever-growing fear chilling my heart. \\nFinally, I came to the hall door and foun d it open. It was not wide open, but the \\ncatch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the \\ndoor every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There \\nwas no time to think of what might ha ppen. A vague over-mastering fear \\nobscured all details.  \\nI took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was \\nin the Crescent, and there was not a soul in  sight. I ran along the North Terrace, \\nbut could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the \\nhope or fear, I don\\'t know which, of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat.  \\nThere was a bright full moon, with he avy black, driving clouds, which \\nthrew the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed \\nacross. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud \\nobscured St. Mary\\'s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could \\nsee the ruins of the abbey coming into view, and as the edge of a narrow band \\nof light as sharp as a sword-cut move d along, the church and churchyard \\nbecame gradually visible . Whatever my expect ation was, it was not \\ndisappointed, for there, on our favourite se at, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. Th e coming of the clou d was too quick for \\nme to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately, but it \\nseemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat  where the white \\nfigure shone, and bent over it. What it wa s, whether man or beast, I could not \\ntell.  \\nI did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the \\npier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to \\nreach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see. I \\nrejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no  witness of poor Lucy\\'s condition. The \\ntime and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came \\nlaboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, \\nand yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though \\nevery joint in my body were rusty.  \\nWhen I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I \\nwas now close enough to distinguish it ev en through the spells of shadow. \\nThere was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-\\nreclining white figure. I called in fright,  \"Lucy! Lucy!\" and something raised a \\nhead, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes.  \\nLucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I \\nentered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost \\nsight of her. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the \\nmoonlight struck so brillian tly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her \\nhead lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a \\nsign of any living thing about.  \\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were \\nparted, and she was breathing, not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy \\ngasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came close, \\nshe put up her hand in her sleep and pull ed the collar of her nightdress close \\naround her, as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and \\ndrew the edges tight around her neck, fo r I dreaded lest she should get some \\ndeadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at \\nonce, so, in order to have my hands free to help her, I fastened the shawl at her \\nthroat with a big safety pin. But I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and \\npinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became \\nquieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I had her \\ncarefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet, and then began very gently to \\nwake her.  At first she did not resp ond, but gradually she became more and more \\nuneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was \\npassing fast, and for many other reasons,  I wished to get her home at once, I \\nshook her forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not \\nseem surprised to see me, as, of course , she did not realize all at once where \\nshe was.  \\nLucy always wakes prettily , and even at such a tim e, when her body must \\nhave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad \\nin a churchyard at night, she did not lo se her grace. She trembled a little, and \\nclung to me. When I told her to come at  once with me home, she rose without a \\nword, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She stopped and wanted to  insist upon my \\ntaking my shoes, but I would not. Ho wever, when we got to the pathway \\noutside the chruchyard, wher e there was a puddle of wa ter, remaining from the \\nstorm, I daubed my feet with mud, usi ng each foot in turn on the other, so that \\nas we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my \\nbare feet.  \\nFortune favoured us, and we got hom e without meeting a soul. Once we \\nsaw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us. \\nBut we hid in a door till he had disapp eared up an opening such as there are \\nhere, steep little closes, or \\'wynds\\', as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat \\nso loud all the time sometimes I thoug ht I should faint. I was filled with anxiety \\nabout Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and \\nhad washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked \\nher into bed. Before falling asleep she asked, even implored, me not to say a \\nword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure.  \\nI hesitated at first, to promise, but on thinking of the state of her mother\\'s \\nhealth, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and think too, of \\nhow such a story might be come distorted, nay, inf allibly would, in case it \\nshould leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so  perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. \\nLucy is sleeping soundly. The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea  \\nSame day, noon.--All goes well. Lucy sl ept till I woke her and seemed not \\nto have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her, on the contrary, it has be nefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness \\nwith the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it migh t have been serious, for the skin of \\nher throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have \\ntransfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band \\nof her nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.  \\nSame day, night.--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun \\nbright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, \\nMrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and \\njoining her at the gate. I felt a little sa d myself, for I could not but feel how \\nabsolutely happy it would have been ha d Jonathan been with me. But there! I \\nmust only be patient. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and \\nheard some good music by Spohr and Ma ckenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy \\nseems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I \\nshall lock the door and secure the ke y the same as before, though I do not \\nexpect any trouble tonight.  \\n12 August.--My expectations were wr ong, for twice during the night I was \\nwakened by Lucy trying to get out. She s eemed, even in her sleep, to be a little \\nimpatient at finding the door shut, and we nt back to bed under a sort of protest. \\nI woke with the dawn, and heard the bi rds chirping outside of the window. \\nLucy woke, too, and I was glad to see, wa s even better than on the previous \\nmorning. All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she \\ncame and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur. I told her how \\nanxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she \\nsucceeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can\\'t alter facts, it can make them \\nmore bearable.  \\n13 August.--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as \\nbefore. Again I awoke in the night, a nd found Lucy sitting up in bed, still \\nasleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, \\nlooked out. It was brillian t moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the \\nsea and sky, merged together in one great  silent mystery, was beautiful beyond \\nwords. Between me and the moonlight flitt ed a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close, bu t was, I suppose, \\nfrightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. \\nWhen I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was \\nsleeping peacefully. She did not stir again all night.  \\n14 August.--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems to \\nhave become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her \\naway from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This \\nafternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had \\ncome to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the \\nview, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just \\ndropping behind Kettleness. The red li ght was thrown over on the East Cliff \\nand the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We \\nwere silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself  \\n\"His red eyes again! They are just  the same.\" It was such an odd \\nexpression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me. I slewed round \\na little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she \\nwas in a half dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite \\nmake out, so I said nothin g, but followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking \\nover at our own seat, whereon was a dark  figure seated alone. I was quite a \\nlittle startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great \\neyes like burning flames, but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary\\'s Church behind our seat, and \\nas the sun dipped there was just suffi cient change in the refraction and \\nreflection to make it appear as if the li ght moved. I called Lucy\\'s attention to \\nthe peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same. It may have been that she was thi nking of that terrib le night up there. \\nWe never refer to it, so I said nothing,  and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a \\nheadache and went early to bed. I saw he r asleep, and went out for a little stroll \\nmyself.  \\nI walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, \\nfor I was thinking of Jonathan. Wh en coming home, it was then bright \\nmoonlight, so bright that, though the fr ont of our part of the Crescent was in \\nshadow, everything could be well seen, I threw a glance up at our window, and \\nsaw Lucy\\'s head leaning out. I opened  my handkerchief and waved it. She did \\nnot notice or make any movement what ever. Just then, the moonlight crept \\nround an angle of the building, a nd the light fell on the window. There \\ndistinctly was Lucy with he r head lying up against the  side of the window sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window sill, \\nwas something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a \\nchill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her \\nbed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily. She was holding her hand to her throat, \\nas though to protect if from the cold.  \\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly. I have taken care that the \\ndoor is locked and the w indow securely fastened.  \\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is paler than is her wont, and \\nthere is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it is.  \\n15 August.--Rose later than usual. Lucy  was languid and tired, and slept \\non after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast. Arthur\\'s \\nfather is better, and wants the marriage to  come off soon. Lucy is full of quiet \\njoy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day she told me \\nthe cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as  her very own, but she is rejoiced that \\nshe is soon to have some one to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got her death warrant. She has not told Lucy, and \\nmade me promise secrecy. Her doctor to ld her that within a few months, at \\nmost, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a \\nsudden shock would be almost sure to k ill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from \\nher the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy\\'s sleep-walking.  \\n17 August.--No diary for tw o whole days. I have not had the heart to write. \\nSome sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness. No news \\nfrom Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother\\'s \\nhours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy\\'s fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air, but all the time \\nthe roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day \\nby day. At night I hear her gasping as if for air.  \\nI keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she \\ngets up and walks about the room, and s its at the open window. Last night I \\nfound her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not.  She was in a faint. When I managed to re store her, she was weak as water, \\nand cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her \\nhow she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away.  \\nI trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I \\nlooked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to \\nhave healed. They are still open, and, if  anything, larger than before, and the \\nedges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dot s with red centres. \\nUnless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about \\nthem.  \\nLETTER, SAMUEL F.

Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all night, and \\ndid not disturb me once.  \\nThe roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still \\nsadly pale and wan-looking. If she were  in any way anemic I could understand \\nit, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of lif e and cheerfulness. All the \\nmorbid reticence seems to have passed from  her, and she has just reminded me, \\nas if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very \\nseat, I found her asleep.  \\nAs she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone \\nslab and said,  \\n\"My poor little feet didn\\'t make much  noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. \\nSwales would have told me that it was because I didn\\'t want to wake up \\nGeordie.\"  \\nAs she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had \\ndreamed at all that night.  Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, \\nwhich Arthur, I call him Arthur from he r habit, says he loves, and indeed, I \\ndon\\'t wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as \\nif trying to recall it to herself.  \\n\"I didn\\'t quite dream, but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here \\nin this spot. I don\\'t know why, for I was afraid of something, I don\\'t know what. \\nI remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and \\nover the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I \\nheard a lot of dogs howling. The whole town seemed as if it must be full of \\ndogs all howling at once, as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of \\nsomething long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and \\nsomething very sweet and very bitter a ll around me at once. And then I seemed \\nsinking into deep green water, and ther e was a singing in my ears, as I have \\nheard there is to drowning men, and th en everything seemed passing away \\nfrom me. My soul seemed to go out from  my body and float about the air. I \\nseem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then \\nthere was a sort of agonizing feeling, as  if I were in an earthquake, and I came \\nback and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you.\"  \\nThen she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to \\nher breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like her \\nold self again. When we got home the fr esh breeze had braced her up, and her \\npale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.  \\n19 August.--Joy, joy, joy! Although not all joy. At last, news of Jonathan. \\nThe dear fellow has been ill, that is  why he did not write. I am not afraid to \\nthink it or to say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent  me on the letter, and \\nwrote himself, oh so kindly. I am to leave in the morning and go over to \\nJonathan, and to help to nurse him if  necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. \\nHawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there. I \\nhave cried over the good Sister\\'s letter ti ll I can feel it wet against my bosom, \\nwhere it lies. It is of Jonathan, and must be  near my heart, for he is in my heart. \\nMy journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one \\nchange of dress. Lucy will bring my trunk  to London and keep it till I send for \\nit, for it may be that I must write no more. I must keep it to say to Jonathan, \\nmy husband. The letter that he has seen  and touched must comfort me till we \\nmeet.   \\nLETTER, SISTER AGATHA, HOSPITA L OF ST. JOSEPH AND STE. \\nMARY BUDA-PESTH, TO MISS WILLHELMINA MURRAY  \\n12 August,  \\n\"Dear Madam.  \\n\"I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong \\nenough to write, though progressing well, th anks to God and St. Joseph and Ste. \\nMary.

He wishes me to convey his love, and to say that by this post I \\nwrite for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins, Exet er, to say, with his dutiful respects, \\nthat he is sorry for his delay, and that all of his work is completed.

Be careful of him always that \\nthere may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come. The \\ntraces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away. We should have written \\nlong ago, but we knew nothing of his fr iends, and there was nothing on him, \\nnothing that anyone could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, \\nand the guard was told by the station mast er there that he ru shed into the station \\nshouting for a ticket  for home. Seeing from his vi olent demeanour that he was \\nEnglish, they gave him a ticket for the furthest stat ion on the way thither that \\nthe train reached.  \\n\"Be assured that he is well cared fo r.

There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years for you \\nboth.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  19 August.--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last ni ght. About eight \\no\\'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The \\nattendant was struck by his manner,  and knowing my interest in him, \\nencouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times \\nservile, but tonight, the man tells me, he was quite haughty. Would not \\ncondescend to talk with him at all.  \\nAll he would say was, \"I don\\'t want to talk to you. You don\\'t count now. \\nThe master is at hand.\"  \\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has \\nseized him. If so, we must look out fo r squalls, for a st rong man with homicidal \\nand religious mania at once might be dangerous. The combination is a dreadful \\none.  \\nAt nine o\\'clock I visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as \\nthat to the attendant. In hi s sublime self-feeling the difference between myself \\nand the attendant seemed to him as nothing.  It looks like religious mania, and \\nhe will soon think that he himself is God.  \\nThese infinitesimal distinctions betw een man and man are too paltry for an \\nOmnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves away! The real God \\ntaketh heed lest a sparrow fall. But the God created from human vanity sees no \\ndifference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!  \\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and \\ngreater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict \\nobservation all the same. All at once th at shifty look came into his eyes which \\nwe always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asyl um attendants come to know so well. \\nHe became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and \\nlooked into space with lack-luster eyes.  I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and \\ntried to lead him to talk of his pets, a the me which had never failed to excite his \\nattention.  \\nAt first he made no reply, but at leng th said testily, \"Bother them all! I \\ndon\\'t care a pin about them.\"  \\n\"What?\" I said. \"You don\\'t mean to te ll me you don\\'t care about spiders?\" \\n(Spiders at present are his hobby and the note book is filling up with columns of \\nsmall figures.)  \\nTo this he answered enigmatically, \"The Bride maidens rejoice the eyes \\nthat wait the coming of the bride. But when the bride draweth nigh, then the \\nmaidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.\"  \\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed \\nall the time I remained with him.  \\nI am weary tonight and low  in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and how \\ndifferent things might have been. If I don\\' t sleep at once, chloral, the modern \\nMorpheus! I must be careful not to let it gr ow into a habit. No, I shall take none \\ntonight! I have thought of  Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the \\ntwo. If need be, tonig ht shall be sleepless.  \\nLater.--Glad I made the resolution, gladder that I kept to it. I had lain \\ntossing about, and had heard the clock strike on ly twice, when the night \\nwatchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. \\nI threw on my clothes and ran down at once. My patient is too dangerous a \\nperson to be roaming abou t. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously \\nwith strangers.  \\nThe attendant was waiting for me. He sa id he had seen him not ten minutes \\nbefore, seemingly asleep in his bed,  when he had looked through the \\nobservation trap in the door. His a ttention was called by the sound of the \\nwindow being wrenched out.  He ran back and saw his feet disappear through \\nthe window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in hi s night gear, and \\ncannot be far off.  The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should \\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst ge tting out of the \\nbuilding by the door. He is a bulky man,  and couldn\\'t get through the window.  \\nI am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and as we were only \\na few feet above ground landed unhurt.  \\nThe attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a \\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt of trees I \\nsaw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.  \\nI ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately \\nand follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield\\'s figure ju st disappearing behind the angle of \\nthe house, so I ran after him. On the far side of the house I found him pressed \\nclose against the old iron-bound oak door of the chapel.  \\nHe was talking, apparently to some one , but I was afraid to go near enough \\nto hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off.  \\nChasing an errant swarm of bees is  nothing to following a naked lunatic, \\nwhen the fit of escaping is upon him! Af ter a few minutes, however, I could see \\nthat he did not take note of anything around him, a nd so ventured to draw \\nnearer to him, the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in. I heard him say  \\n\"I am here to do your bidding, Mast er. I am your slave, and you will \\nreward me, for I shall be faithful. I ha ve worshipped you l ong and afar off. \\nNow that you are near, I await your co mmands, and you will not pass me by, \\nwill you, dear Master, in your distribution of good things?\"  \\nHe is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes even \\nwhen he believes his is in a real Presence. His manias make a startling \\ncombination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is \\nimmensely strong, for he was more  like a wild beast than a man.  \\nI never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before, and I hope I shall \\nnot again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild \\nwork before he was caged.  He is safe now, at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn\\'t get free from \\nthe strait waistcoat that keeps him restra ined, and he\\'s chained to the wall in the \\npadded room.  \\nHis cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly \\nstill, for he means murder in every turn and movement.  \\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the  first time. \"I shall be patient, \\nMaster. It is coming, coming, coming!\"  \\nSo I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary \\nhas quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep tonight.  \\nCHAPTER 9  \\nLETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA  \\nBuda-Pe\\nsth, 24 August.  \\n\"My dearest Lucy,  \\n\"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted \\nat the railway station at Whitby.  \\n\"Well, my dear, I got to Hull all righ t, and caught the boat to Hamburg, \\nand then the train on here. I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, \\nexcept that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and that as I should have to do \\nsome nursing, I had better get all the slee p I could. I found my dear one, oh, so \\nthin and pale and weak -looking. All the res olution has gone out of his dear eyes, \\nand that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished. He is only \\na wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never \\nask.  \\n\"He has had some terrible shock, and I f ear it might tax his poor brain if he \\nwere to try to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, \\ntells me that he wanted her to tell me  what they were, but she would only cross \\nherself, and say she would never tell. Th at the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse thr ough her vocation should hear them, she \\nshould respect her trust.  \\n\"She is a sweet, good soul, and the ne xt day, when she saw I was troubled, \\nshe opened up the subject my poor dear raved about, added, \\'I can tell you this \\nmuch, my dear. That it was not abo ut anything which he has done wrong \\nhimself, and you, as his wife to be, have  no cause to be concerned. He has not \\nforgotten you or what he ow es to you. His fear was of  great and terrible things, \\nwhich no mortal can treat of.\\'  \\n\"I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear \\nshould have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of my being jealous \\nabout Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me  whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through \\nme when I knew that no other woman was a cause for trouble. I am now sitting \\nby his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking!  \\n\"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something \\nfrom the pocket. I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things. I saw amongst them was his notebook, and was going to ask him to let me look at it, \\nfor I knew that I might find some clue to his trouble, but I suppose he must \\nhave seen my wish in my eyes, for he  sent me over to the window, saying he \\nwanted to be quite alone for a moment.  \\n\"Then he called me back, and he said to me very solemnly, \\'Wilhelmina\\', I \\nknew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him, \\'Y ou know, dear, my ideas of the trust \\nbetween husband and wife. There should be no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was r eal of the dreaming of a madman. You \\nknow I had brain fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not \\nwant to know it. I want to take up my lif e here, with our marriage.\\' For, my \\ndear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete. \\'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my  ignorance? Here is the book. Take it \\nand keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back  to the bitter hours, asleep or \\nawake, sane or mad, recorded here.\\' He fell back exhausted, and I put the book \\nunder his pillow, and kissed him. I have  asked Sister Agatha to beg the \\nSuperior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply\"  \\n \"She has come and told me that the Chaplain of the English mission \\nchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or  as soon after as \\nJonathan awakes.\"  \\n\"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very \\nhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in \\nbed, propped up with pillows. He answer ed his \\'I will\\' firmly and strong. I \\ncould hardly speak. My heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me.  \\n\"The dear sisters were so kind. Pleas e, God, I shall never, never forget \\nthem, nor the grave and swee t responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell \\nyou of my wedding prese nt. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me \\nalone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words \\n\\'my husband\\'--left me alone with my hus band, I took the book from under his \\npillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, an d tied it with a little  bit of pale blue \\nribbon which was round my neck, and sealed  it over the knot with sealing wax, \\nand for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my \\nhusband, and told him that I would keep it  so, and then it would be an outward \\nand visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other, that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern \\nduty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took \\nhis wife\\'s hand, and said that it was the  dearest thing in all the wide world, and \\nthat he would go through all the past agai n to win it, if need be. The poor dear \\nmeant to have said a part of the past, b ut he cannot think of ti me yet, and I shall \\nnot wonder if at first he mixes up  not only the month, but the year.  \\n\"Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the \\nhappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him \\nexcept myself, my life, and my trust, a nd that with these we nt my love and duty \\nfor all the days of my life. And, my d ear, when he kissed me, and drew me to \\nhim with his poor weak hands, it was like a solemn pledge between us.  \\n\"Lucy dear, do you know  why I tell you all this? It  is not only because it is \\nall sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to \\nprepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very \\nhappy wife, whither duty has led me, so that in your own married life you too \\nmay be all happy, as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all \\nit promises, a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no \\ndistrust. I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be, but I do hope you \\nwill be always as happy as I am now. Goodbye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop , for Jonathan is \\nwaking. I must attend my husband!  \\n\"Your ever-loving Mina Harker.\"  \\nLETTER, LUCY WESTENRA  TO MINA HARKER.  \\nWhitby, 30 August.  \\n\"My dearest Mina,  \\n\"Oceans of love and millions of kisses,  and may you soon be in your own \\nhome with your husband. I wish you were coming home soon enough to stay \\nwith us here. The strong air would soon re store Jonathan. It has quite restored \\nme. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well. You will \\nbe glad to know that I have  quite given up walking in  my sleep. I think I have \\nnot stirred out of my bed for a week, tha t is when I once got into it at night. \\nArthur says I am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. \\nWe have such walks and drives, and ride s, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing \\ntogether, and I love him more than ever . He tells me that he loves me more, but \\nI doubt that, for at first he  told me that he couldn\\'t l ove me more than he did \\nthen. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present \\nfrom your loving,  \\n\"Lucy.  \\n\"P.S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.  \"P.P.S.--We are to be married on 28 September.\"  \\nDR. SEWARDS DIARY  \\n20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has \\nnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion. For the \\nfirst week after his attack he was perpetua lly violent. Then one night, just as the \\nmoon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murm uring to himself. \"Now I can wait. \\nNow I can wait.\"  The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. \\nHe was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused \\nlook had gone from his face, and his eyes  had something of the ir old pleading. I \\nmight almost say, cringing, softness. I was satisfied with his  present condition, \\nand directed him to be relieved. The atte ndants hesitated, but finally carried out \\nmy wishes without protest.  \\nIt was a strange thing that the pati ent had humour enough to see their \\ndistrust, for, coming close to me, he sa id in a whisper, a ll the while looking \\nfurtively at them, \"They think I coul d hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The \\nfools!\"  \\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the fee lings to find myself disassociated \\neven in the mind of this poor madman fr om the others, but all the same I do not \\nfollow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so \\nthat we are, as it were, to stand together. Or has he to gain from me some good \\nso stupendous that my well being is ne edful to Him? I must find out later on. \\nTonight he will not speak. Even the offe r of a kitten or even a full-grown cat \\nwill not tempt him.  \\nHe will only say, \"I don\\'t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of \\nnow, and I can wait. I can wait.\"  \\nAfter a while I left him. The attenda nt tells me that he was quiet until just \\nbefore dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at leng th violent, until \\nat last he fell into a paroxysm which ex hausted him so that he swooned into a \\nsort of coma.  \\n. . . Three nights has the same thing ha ppened, violent all day then quiet \\nfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I cou ld get some clue to the cause. It would \\nalmost seem as if there was some  influence which came and went. Happy \\nthought! We shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped before \\nwithout our help. Tonight he  shall escape with it. We shall give him a chance, \\nand have the men ready to follow in case they are required.  \\n23 August.--\"The expected always ha ppens.\" How well Disraeli knew life. \\nOur bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so  all our subtle \\narrangements were for nought. At any ra te, we have proved one thing, that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able to ease his \\nbonds for a few hours each day. I have given orders to th e night attendant \\nmerely to shut him in the padded room, wh en once he is quie t, until the hour \\nbefore sunrise. The poor soul\\'s body w ill enjoy the relief even if his mind \\ncannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I am called. The patient has \\nonce more escaped.  \\nLater.--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the \\nattendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and \\nflew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow. Again he went \\ninto the grounds of the deserted hous e, and we found him in the same place, \\npressed against the old chapel door. When  he saw me he became furious, and \\nhad not the attendants seized  him in time, he would have  tried to kill me. As we \\nwere holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, \\nand then as suddenly grew calm. I look ed round instinctively, but could see \\nnothing. Then I caught the patient\\'s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing \\nas it looked into the moonli ght sky, except a big bat, which was flapping its \\nsilent and ghostly way to the west. Ba ts usually wheel ab out, but this one \\nseemed to go straight on, as if it kne w where it was bound for or had some \\nintention of its own.  \\nThe patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said, \"You needn\\'t tie \\nme. I shall go quietly!\" With out trouble, we came back to the house. I feel there \\nis something ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night.  \\nLUCY WESTENRA\\'S DIARY  \\nHillingham, 24 August.--I mu st imitate Mina, and keep writing things \\ndown. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will be. \\nI wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last ni ght I seemed to be \\ndreaming again just as I wa s at Whitby. Perhaps it is the change of air, or \\ngetting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing. \\nBut I am full of vague fear, and I feel  so weak and worn out. When Arthur \\ncame to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn\\'t the spirit \\nto try to be cheerful. I wonder if I could sleep in mother\\'s room tonight. I shall \\nmake an excuse to try.  \\n 25 August.--Another bad night. M other did not seem to take to my \\nproposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me. I \\ntried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while, but when the clock struck \\ntwelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep. There was \\na sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I \\nremember no more, I suppose I must have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I \\nwish I could remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is \\nghastly pale, and my throat pains me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don\\'t seem to be getting ai r enough. I shall try to cheer up when \\nArthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.  \\nLETTER, ARTHUR TO DR. SEWARD  \\n\"Albemarle Hotel, 31 August  \\n\"My dear Jack,  \\n\"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is il l, that is she has no special disease, \\nbut she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have asked her if there is \\nany cause, I not dare to ask her mother,  for to disturb the poor lady\\'s mind \\nabout her daughter in her present state of  health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra \\nhas confided to me that her doom is spoke n, disease of the heart, though poor \\nLucy does not know it yet. I am sure that there is something preying on my \\ndear girl\\'s mind. I am almost distracte d when I think of her. To look at her \\ngives me a pang. I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she \\ndemurred at first, I know why, old fellow, she finally consented. It will be a \\npainful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for her sake, and I must not \\nhesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at Hillingham tomorrow, \\ntwo o\\'clock, so as not to arouse any sus picion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch \\nLucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you. I am filled with anxiety, \\nand want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her. Do \\nnot fail!  \\n\"Arthur.\"  \\nTELEGRAM, ARTHUR HOLMWOOD TO SEWARD  \\n1 September  \"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me \\nfully by tonight\\'s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.\"  \\nLETTER FROM DR. SEWARD TO ARTHUR HOLMWOOD  \\n2 September  \"My dear old fellow,  \\n\"With regard to Miss Westenra\\'s health I hasten to let you know at once \\nthat in my opinion there is not any func tional disturbance or any malady that I \\nknow of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her \\nappearance. She is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last. \\nOf course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of \\nexamination such as I shou ld wish. Our very friendsh ip makes a little difficulty \\nwhich not even medical scie nce or custom can bridge over. I had better tell you \\nexactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own \\nconclusions. I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.  \\n\"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present, \\nand in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to \\nmislead her mother and prevent her from  being anxious. I have no doubt she \\nguesses, if she does not know, wh at need of caution there is.  \\n\"We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, \\nas some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. \\nThen Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went \\ninto her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants \\nwere coming and going.  \\n\"As soon as the door was closed, howev er, the mask fell from her face, and \\nshe sank down into a chair with a grea t sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. \\nWhen I saw that her high spirits had fa iled, I at once took advantage of her \\nreaction to make a diagnosis.  \\n\"She said to me very sweetly, \\'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about \\nmyself.\\' I reminded her that a doctor\\'s confidence was sacred, but that you were \\ngrievously anxious about her.  She caught on to my mean ing at once, and settled \\nthat matter in a word. \\'Tell Arthur ever ything you choose. I do not care for \\nmyself, but for him!\\' So I am quite free.  \"I could easily see that she was so mewhat bloodless, but I could not see \\nthe usual anemic signs, and by the chance, I was able to test the actual quality \\nof her blood, for in openi ng a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she \\ncut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter in itself, but it \\ngave me an evident chance, and I secure d a few drops of the blood and have \\nanalysed them.  \\n\"The qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition, and shows, I \\nshould infer, in itself a vigorous state of  health. In other physical matters I was \\nquite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety, but as there must be a cause \\nsomewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental.  \\n\"She complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, \\nlethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child, she used to walk in her sleep, and \\nthat when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Mi ss Murray found her. But she assures me \\nthat of late the habit has not returned.  \\n\"I am in doubt, and so have done the be st thing I know of. I have written to \\nmy old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to \\ncome over, and as you told me that all th ings were to be at your charge, I have \\nmentioned to him who you are and your re lations to Miss Westenra. This, my \\ndear fellow, is in obedience to your wi shes, for I am only too proud and happy \\nto do anything I can for her.  \\n\"Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so \\nno matter on what ground he comes, we  must accept his wishes. He is a \\nseemingly arbitrary man, this is because he knows what he is talking about \\nbetter than any one else. He is a philo sopher and a metaphysician, and one of \\nthe most advanced scientists of his day,  and he has, I believe, an absolutely \\nopen mind. This, with an iron nerve, a te mper of the ice-bro ok, and indomitable \\nresolution, self-command, a nd toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and \\nthe kindliest and truest h eart that beats, these form his equipment for the noble \\nwork that he is doing for mankind, work  both in theory and practice, for his \\nviews are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you \\nmay know why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow again. She is to meet me at the \\nStores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.  \\n\"Yours always.\"  John Seward  \\nLETTER, ABRAHAM VAN HELSING, MD, DPh, D. Lit, ETC, ETC, \\nTO DR. SEWARD  \\n2 September.  \\n\"My good Friend,  \\n\"When I received your letter I am al ready coming to you.

ARTHUR HOLMWOOD  \\n3 September  \"My dear Art,  \\n\"Van Helsing has come and gone. He  came on with me to Hillingham, and \\nfound that, by Lucy\\'s discretion, her m other was lunching out, so that we were \\nalone with her.  \\n\"Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient. He is to \\nreport to me, and I shall advise you, for of  course I was not present all the time. \\nHe is, I fear, much concerned, but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the ma tter, he said, \\'You must tell him all \\nyou think. Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if  you will. Nay, I am not \\njesting. This is no jest, but life and deat h, perhaps more.\\' I asked what he meant \\nby that, for he was very serious. This was when we had come back to town, and \\nhe was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam. He \\nwould not give me any further clue. You must not be angry with me, Art, \\nbecause his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good. \\nHe will speak plainly enough when the ti me comes, be sure. So I told him I \\nwould simply write an account of our visit,  just as if I were doing a descriptive \\nspecial article for THE DAILY TELEGRA PH. He seemed not to notice, but \\nremarked that the smuts of London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here. I am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly \\nmake it. In any case I am to have a letter.  \\n\"Well, as to the visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw \\nher, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the ghastly look that \\nso upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the \\nProfessor (as she always is), and tried to  make him feel at ease, though I could \\nsee the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.  \\n\"I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his \\nbushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of all things except \\nourselves and diseases and with such an  infinite geniality tha t I could see poor \\nLucy\\'s pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming \\nchange, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said,  \\n\"\\'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so \\nmuch beloved. That is much, my dear, even were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit,  and that you were of a ghastly pale. \\nTo them I say \"Pouf!\"\\' And he snapped his fingers at me and went on. \\'But you \\nand I shall show them how wrong they are.  How can he,\\' and he pointed at me \\nwith the same look and gesture as that with which he pointed me out in his \\nclass, on, or rather after, a particular  occasion which he never fails to remind \\nme of, \\'know anything of a young ladies? He has his madmen to play with, and \\nto bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, \\nand, oh, but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness. But the \\nyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell \\nthemselves to the young, but to the o ld, like me, who have known so many \\nsorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.\\' I \\ntook the hint, and strolled about, a nd presently the professor came to the \\nwindow and called me in. He looked grave, but said, \\'I have made careful examination, but there is no functiona l cause. With you I agree that there has \\nbeen much blood lost, it has been but is not. But the conditio ns of her are in no \\nway anemic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or \\ntwo questions, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she \\nwill say. And yet there is cause. There is always cause for everything. I must go \\nback home and think. You must send me the telegram every day, and if there \\nbe cause I shall come again. The disease, for not to be well is a disease, interest \\nme, and the sweet, young dear, she interes t me too. She charm me, and for her, \\nif not for you or disease, I come.\\'  \\n\"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone. \\nAnd so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust your \\npoor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to \\nbe placed in such a position between two people who ar e both so dear to you. I \\nknow your idea of duty to your  father, and you are right to stick to it. But if \\nneed be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy, so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  4 September.--Zoophagous patient sti ll keeps up our interest in him. He \\nhad only one outburst and th at was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the \\nstroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, \\nand at once summoned aid. Fortunately th e men came at a run, and were just in \\ntime, for at the stroke of noon he b ecame so violent that it took all their \\nstrength to hold him. In ab out five minutes, however, he began to get more \\nquiet, and finally sank into a sort of mela ncholy, in which state he has remained \\nup to now. The attendant tells me that hi s screams whilst in the paroxysm were \\nreally appalling. I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the \\nother patients who were frightened by hi m. Indeed, I can quite understand the \\neffect, for the sounds dist urbed even me, though I wa s some distance away. It \\nis now after the dinner hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner \\nbrooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-bego ne look in his face, which seems rather \\nto indicate than to show something direct ly. I cannot quite understand it.  \\nLater.--Another change in my patient. At five o\\'clock I looked in on him, \\nand found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was \\ncatching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When he saw \\nme, he came over and apologized for hi s bad conduct, and asked me in a very \\nhumble, cringing way to be led back to hi s own room, and to have his notebook \\nagain. I thought it well to humour him, so he is back in his room with the \\nwindow open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is  not now eating them, but putting them \\ninto a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a \\nspider. I tried to get him to talk about th e past few days, for any clue to his \\nthoughts would be of immense help to me , but he would not rise. For a moment \\nor two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far away  voice, as though \\nsaying it rather to himself than to me.  \\n\"All over! All over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do \\nit myself!\" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said, \"Doctor, won\\'t you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar? I think it \\nwould be very good for me.\"  \\n\"And the flies?\" I said.  \\n\"Yes! The flies like it, t oo, and I like the flies,  therefore I like it.\" And \\nthere are people who know so little as  to think that madmen do not argue. I \\nprocured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any \\nin the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.   \\nMidnight.--Another change  in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, \\nwhom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own \\ngate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his room is \\non this side of the house, I could hear it  better than in the morning. It was a \\nshock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows an d all the marvellous tints that come on \\nfoul clouds even as on foul wa ter, and to realize all the  grim sternness of my \\nown cold stone building, wi th its wealth of breathing misery, and my own \\ndesolate heart to endure it all. I r eached him just as the sun was going down, \\nand from his window saw the red disc sink . As it sank he became less and less \\nfrenzied, and just as it dipped he slid fr om the hands that held him, an inert \\nmass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and \\nlooked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was \\nanxious to see what he would do. He went straight  over to the window and \\nbrushed out the crumbs of sugar. Th en he took his fly box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box. Then he shut the window, and crossing over, \\nsat down on his bed. All th is surprised me, so I as ked him, \"Are you going to \\nkeep flies any more?\"  \\n\"No,\" said he. \"I am sick of all that  rubbish!\" He certainly is a wonderfully \\ninteresting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of \\nhis sudden passion. Stop. There may be a clue after all, if we can find why \\ntoday his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is \\na malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures, as at \\ntimes the moon does others? We shall see.  \\nTELEGRAM.

ARTHUR HOLMWOOD  \\n6 Septem\\nber  \"My dear Art,  \\n\"My news today is not so good. Lucy  this morning had gone back a bit. \\nThere is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it. Mrs. Westenra was \\nnaturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about \\nher. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van \\nHelsing, the great specialist, was com ing to stay with me, and that I would put \\nher in his charge conjointly with myself . So now we can come and go without \\nalarming her unduly, for a shock to her w ould mean sudden death, and this, in \\nLucy\\'s weak condition, might be disa strous to her. We are hedged in with \\ndifficulties, all of us, my poor fellow, but, please God, we shall come through them all right. If any need I shall write,  so that, if you do not hear from me, \\ntake it for granted that I am simp ly waiting for news, In haste,  \\n\"Yours ever,\"  \\nJohn Seward  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  7 September.--The first thing Van Hels ing said to me when we met at \\nLiverpool Street was, \"Have you said an ything to our young friend, to lover of \\nher?\"  \\n\"No,\" I said. \"I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote \\nhim a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was \\nnot so well, and that I should let him know if need be.\"  \\n\"Right, my friend,\" he said. \"Quite ri ght! Better he not know as yet. \\nPerhaps he will never know. I pray so, but if it be needed, then he shall know \\nall. And, my good friend John, let me cau tion you. You deal with the madmen. \\nAll men are mad in some way or the other,  and inasmuch as you deal discreetly \\nwith your madmen, so deal with God\\'s ma dmen too, the rest of the world. You \\ntell not your madmen what you do no r why you do it. You tell them not what \\nyou think. So you sh all keep knowledge in its place,  where it may rest, where it \\nmay gather its kind around it and breed. Y ou and I shall keep as yet what we \\nknow here, and here.\" He touched me on  the heart and on the forehead, and \\nthen touched himself the same way. \"I ha ve for myself thoughts at the present. \\nLater I shall unfold to you.\"  \"Why not now?\" I asked. \"It may do some good. We may arrive at some \\ndecision.\" He looked at me and said, \"My friend John, when the corn is grown, \\neven before it has ripened, while the m ilk of its mother earth is in him, and the \\nsunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull \\nthe ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you, \\'Look! He\\'s  good corn, he will make a good crop when the time \\ncomes.\\'\"  \\nI did not see the applicat ion and told him so. For reply he reached over and \\ntook my ear in his hand and pulled it pla yfully, as he used long ago to do at \\nlectures, and said, \"The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, \\nbut not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted \\ncorn to see if he grow. That is for the  children who play at husbandry, and not \\nfor those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I \\nhave sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout, if he \\nsprout at all, there\\'s some promise, a nd I wait till the ear begins to swell.\" He \\nbroke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on gravely, \\n\"You were always a careful student, and your case bo ok was ever more full \\nthan the rest. And I trust that good habi t have not fail. Remember, my friend, \\nthat knowledge is stronger than memory , and we should not trust the weaker. \\nEven if you have not kept the good practice,  let me tell you that this case of our \\ndear miss is one that may be, mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and \\nothers that all the rest may not make him  kick the beam, as your people say. \\nTake then good note of it.  Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in \\nrecord even your doubts and surmises. He reafter it may be of interest to you to \\nsee how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!\"  \\nWhen I described Lucy\\'s symptoms, the same as before, but infinitely \\nmore marked, he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a bag \\nin which were many instruments and drugs,  \"the ghastly paraphernalia of our \\nbeneficial trade,\" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a \\nprofessor of the healing craft.  \\nWhen we were shown in, Mrs. Westen ra met us. She was alarmed, but not \\nnearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficient moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, \\nin a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal, even the terrible change in her \\ndaughter to whom she is so  attached, do not seem to r each her. It is something \\nlike the way dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some \\ninsensitive tissue which can protect from  evil that which it would otherwise \\nharm by contact. If this be an ordered se lfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoi sm, for there may be deeper root for \\nits causes than we have knowledge of.  \\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology,  and set down a \\nrule that she should not be present with Lucy, or think of her illness more than \\nwas absolutely required. She assented re adily, so readily that I saw again the \\nhand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy\\'s \\nroom. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her today.  \\nShe was ghastly, chalkily pale. The red seemed to have gone even from her \\nlips and gums, and the bones of her f ace stood out prominently. Her breathing \\nwas painful to see or hear. Van Helsing\\'s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost  touched over his nose. Lucy lay \\nmotionless, and did not seem to have stre ngth to speak, so for a while we were \\nall silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned  to me, and we went gently out of the \\nroom. The instant we had closed the door  he stepped quickly along the passage \\nto the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quick ly in with him and \\nclosed the door. \"My god!\" he said. \"This  is dreadful. There is not time to be \\nlost. She will die for sheer want of blo od to keep the heart\\' s action as it should \\nbe. There must be a transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?\"  \\n\"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.\"  \\n\"Then get ready at once. I will brin g up my bag. I am prepared.\"  \\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the \\nhall door. When we reached the hall, the maid had just opened the door, and \\nArthur was stepping quickly in.  He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper,  \\n\"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have \\nbeen in an agony. The dad was better, so  I ran down here to  see for myself. Is \\nnot that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.\"  \\nWhen first the Professor\\'s eye had lit  upon him, he had been angry at his \\ninterruption at such a time,  but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and \\nrecognized the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his \\neyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him as he held out his hand,  \\n\"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, \\nvery, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go  like that.\" For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. \"You are to help her. You can do more \\nthan any that live, and your courage is your best help.\"  \\n\"What can I do?\" asked Arthur hoarsel y. \"Tell me, and I shall do it. My \\nlife is hers, and I would give the last  drop of blood in my body for her.\"  \\nThe Professor has a strongly humor ous side, and I could from old \\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer.  \\n\"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the last!\"  \\n\"What shall I do?\" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrils \\nquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder.  \\n\"Come!\" he said. \"You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better \\nthan me, better than my friend John.\" Arthur looked bewildered, and the \\nProfessor went on by explai ning in a kindly way.  \\n\"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have \\nor die. My friend John and I have consulted, and we are about to perform what \\nwe call transfusion of blood, to transf er from full veins of one to the empty \\nveins which pine for him. John was to give  his blood, as he is the more young \\nand strong than me.\"--Here Arthur took my  hand and wrung it hard in silence.--\\n\"But now you are here, you are more good than us, old or  young, who toil \\nmuch in the world of thought. Our nerves  are not so calm and our blood so \\nbright than yours!\"  \\nArthur turned to him and said, \"If you only knew how gladly I would die \\nfor her you would understand\" He stopped with a sort of choke in his voice.  \\n\"Good boy!\" said Van Helsing. \"In the not-so-far-off you will be happy \\nthat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be si lent. You shall kiss \\nher once before it is done, but then you mu st go, and you must leave at my sign. \\nSay no word to Madame. You know how it is with her. There must be no shock, \\nany knowledge of this w ould be one. Come!\"  \\nWe all went up to Lucy\\'s room. Arthur by direction remained outside. \\nLucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, \\nbut she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke to us, that was \\nall.  Van Helsing took some things from his  bag and laid them on a little table \\nout of sight. Then he mixed a narcot ic, and coming over to the bed, said \\ncheerily, \"Now, little miss, he re is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good child. \\nSee, I lift you so that to swallow is easy.  Yes.\" She had made the effort with \\nsuccess.  \\nIt astonished me how long the drug to ok to act. This, in fact, marked the \\nextent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in \\nher eyelids. At last, however, the narc otic began to manifest its potency, and \\nshe fell into a deep sleep. When the Prof essor was satisfied, he called Arthur \\ninto the room, and bade him strip off his  coat. Then he added, \"You may take \\nthat one little kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to me!\" So \\nneither of us looked w hilst he bent over her.  \\nVan Helsing, turning to me, said, \"He is so young and st rong, and of blood \\nso pure that we need not defibrinate it.\"  \\nThen with swiftness, but with absolu te method, Van Hels ing performed the \\noperation. As the transfusion went on, so mething like life seemed to come back \\nto poor Lucy\\'s cheeks, and through Arthur \\'s growing pallor the joy of his face \\nseemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of \\nblood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy\\'s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur \\nonly partially restored her.  \\nBut the Professor\\'s face was set, and he stood watch in hand, and with his \\neyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart \\nbeat. Presently, he said in a soft voice, \"Do not stir an instant.  It is enough. You \\nattend him. I will look to her.\"  \\nWhen all was over, I could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed \\nthe wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke \\nwithout turning roun d, the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head, \\n\"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.\" \\nAnd as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient\\'s \\nhead. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to \\nwear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had \\ngiven her, was dragged a little up, a nd showed a red mark on her throat.  \\nArthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath \\nwhich is one of Van Helsing\\'s ways of  betraying emotion. He said nothing at \\nthe moment, but turned to me, saying, \" Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home \\nand rest, sleep much and eat much, that he  may be recruited of what he has so \\ngiven to his love. He must not stay here. Hold a moment! I may take it, sir, that \\nyou are anxious of result. Then bring it with you, that in all ways the operation \\nis successful. You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest \\neasy in mind that all that can be is. I sha ll tell her all when she is well. She shall \\nlove you none the less for what you have done. Goodbye.\"  \\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, \\nbut her breathing was stronger . I could see the counterpane move as her breast \\nheaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsi ng, looking at her intently. The velvet \\nband again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper, \"What do you make of that mark on her throat?\"  \\n\"What do you make of it?\"  \\n\"I have not examined it yet,\" I answered, and then and there proceeded to \\nloose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, \\nnot large, but not wholesome looking. There was no sign  of disease, but the \\nedges were white and worn looking, as if by some trituration. It at once \\noccurred to me that that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood. But I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she \\nhad before the transfusion.  \\n\"Well?\" said Van Helsing.  \\n\"Well,\" said I. \"I can make nothing of it.\"  \\nThe Professor stood up. \"I must go back to Amsterdam tonight,\" he said \\n\"There are books and things there which I want. You must remain here all night, \\nand you must not let your sight pass from her.\"  \\n\"Shall I have a nurse?\" I asked.  \"We are the best nurses, you and I. Y ou keep watch all night. See that she \\nis well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all the night. \\nLater on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And then \\nwe may begin.\"  \\n\"May begin?\" I said. \"What on earth do you mean?\"  \"We shall see!\" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment \\nlater and put his head inside the door an d said with a warning finger held up, \\n\"Remember, she is your charge. If you leav e her, and harm befall, you shall not \\nsleep easy hereafter!\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--CONTINUED  8 September.--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off \\ntowards dusk, and she waked naturally. She looked a different being from what \\nshe had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good, and she was full \\nof a happy vivacity, but I coul d see evidences of the absolute prostration which \\nshe had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had \\ndirected that I should sit up with he r, she almost pooh-poohed the idea, \\npointing out her daughter\\'s  renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, \\nhowever, and made preparations fo r my long vigil. When her maid had \\nprepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and \\ntook a seat by the bedside.  \\nShe did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully \\nwhenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, \\nbut with an effort seemed to pull hersel f together and shook it off. It was \\napparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once.  \\n\"You do not want to sleep?\"  \\n\"No. I am afraid.\"  \"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.\"  \\n\"Ah, not if you were like me, if sl eep was to you a presage of horror!\"  \\n\"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?\"  \\n\"I don\\'t know. Oh, I don\\'t know. And that is what is so terrible. All this \\nweakness comes to me in sleep, unt il I dread the very thought.\"  \\n\"But, my dear girl, you may sleep toni ght. I am here watching you, and I \\ncan promise that nothing will happen.\"  \\n\"Ah, I can trust you!\" she said.  I seized the opportunity, an d said, \"I promise that if I see any evidence of \\nbad dreams I will wake you at once.\"  \\n\"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will \\nsleep!\" And almost at the word she gave  a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, \\nasleep.  \\nAll night long I watched by her. She ne ver stirred, but sl ept on and on in a \\ndeep, tranquil, life-giving, health-givi ng sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, \\nand her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was a \\nsmile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb \\nher peace of mind.  \\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took \\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short wire to \\nVan Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation. \\nMy own work, with its manifold arrears,  took me all day to clear off. It was \\ndark when I was able to inquire about my  zoophagous patient. The report was \\ngood. He had been quite quiet for the  past day and night. A telegram came \\nfrom Van Helsing at Amsterdam whils t I was at dinner, suggesting that I \\nshould be at Hillingham tonight, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating \\nthat he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.  \\n9 September.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham. \\nFor two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my  brain was beginning to \\nfeel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy was up and in \\ncheerful spirits. When she shook hands w ith me she looked sharply in my face \\nand said,  \\n\"No sitting up tonight for you. You are worn out.  I am quite well again. \\nIndeed, I am, and if there is to be a ny sitting up, it is I who will sit up with \\nyou.\"  \\nI would not argue the poin t, but went and had my supper. Lucy came with \\nme, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and \\nhad a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me \\nupstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.  \\n\"Now,\" she said. \"You must stay here. I shall leave this door open and my \\ndoor too. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want \\nanything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.\"  \\nI could not but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and could not have sat up \\nhad I tried. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want \\nanything, I lay on the sofa, a nd forgot all about everything.  \\nLUCY WESTENRA\\'S DIARY  \\n9 September.--I feel so happy tonight. I have been so miserably weak, that \\nto be able to think and move  about is like feeling suns hine after a long spell of \\neast wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me. I \\nseem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is that sickness and \\nweakness are selfish things  and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, \\nwhilst health and stre ngth give love rein, and in t hought and feeling he can \\nwander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If only Arthur knew! \\nMy dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, \\nthe blissful rest of last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward \\nwatching me. And tonight I shal l not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and \\nwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me. Thank God! Goodnight \\nArthur.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n10 September.--I was conscious of the Professor\\'s hand on my head, and \\nstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn in an \\nasylum, at any rate.  \\n\"And how is our patient?\"  \"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,\" I answered.  \"Come, let us see,\" he said. And together we went into the room.  \\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing \\nstepped, with his soft, cat-like  tread, over to the bed.  As I raised the blind, and the morn ing sunlight flooded the room, I heard \\nthe Professor\\'s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot \\nthrough my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of \\nhorror, \"Gott in Himmel!\" needed no enfor cement from his agonized face. He \\nraised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen \\nwhite. I felt my knees begin to tremble.  \\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly \\nwhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums \\nseemed to have shrunken back from the te eth, as we sometimes see in a corpse \\nafter a prolonged illness.  \\nVan Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life \\nand all the long years of ha bit stood to him, and he pu t it down again softly.  \\n\"Quick!\" he said. \"Bring the brandy.\"  \\nI flew to the dining room, and returne d with the decanter. He wetted the \\npoor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He \\nfelt her heart, and after a few moments of agonizing suspense said,  \\n\"It is not too late. It beats, though b ut feebly. All our work is undone. We \\nmust begin again. There is no young Arthur here now. I have to call on you \\nyourself this time, friend John.\" As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and \\nproducing the instruments of transfusion. I had taken of f my coat and rolled up \\nmy shirt sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no \\nneed of one; and so, with out a moment\\'s delay, we began the operation.  \\nAfter a time, it did not seem a short time  either, for the draining away of \\none\\'s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling, Van \\nHelsing held up a warning finger. \"Do not s tir,\" he said. \"But I fear that with \\ngrowing strength she may wake, and tha t would make danger, oh, so much \\ndanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of \\nmorphia.\" He proceeded then, swiftly a nd deftly, to carry out his intent.  \\nThe effect on Lucy was not bad, for the  faint seemed to merge subtly into \\nthe narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of  personal pride that I could see a faint \\ntinge of colour steal back into the pallid  cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he \\nexperiences it, what it is to feel his own lifeblood drawn aw ay into the veins of \\nthe woman he loves.  The Professor watched me critically. \"That will do,\" he said. \"Already?\" I \\nremonstrated. \"You took a great deal more  from Art.\" To which he smiled a sad \\nsort of smile as he replied,  \\n\"He is her lover, her fiance. You have  work, much work to do for her and \\nfor others, and the present will suffice.\"  \\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied \\ndigital pressure to my ow n incision. I laid down, while I waited his leisure to \\nattend to me, for I felt faint and a little  sick. By and by he bound up my wound, \\nand sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the \\nroom, he came after me, and half whispered.  \\n\"Mind, nothing must be said of this . If our young lover should turn up \\nunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and \\nenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!\"  \\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said, \"You are not \\nmuch the worse. Go into the room, and lie  on your sofa, and rest awhile, then \\nhave much breakfast and come here to me.\"  \\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how  right and wise they were. I had \\ndone my part, and now my next duty wa s to keep up my strength. I felt very \\nweak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had \\noccurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again \\nhow Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign any where to show for it. I think I \\nmust have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking my \\nthoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, \\nexhausted appearance of their ed ges, tiny though they were.  \\nLucy slept well into the day, and wh en she woke she was fairly well and \\nstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leavin g me in charge, with strict injunctions \\nthat I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, \\nasking the way to the nearest telegraph office.  \\nLucy chatted with me freely, and s eemed quite unconsciou s that anything \\nhad happened. I tried to keep her amus ed and interested. When her mother \\ncame up to see her, she did not seem to noti ce any change whatever, but said to \\nme gratefully,  \"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really \\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale yourself. \\nYou want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit, that you do!\" As she spoke, \\nLucy turned crimson, though it was on ly momentarily, for her poor wasted \\nveins could not stand for long an unwo nted drain to the head. The reaction \\ncame in excessive pallor as she turne d imploring eyes on me. I smiled and \\nnodded, and laid my finger on my lips. With a sigh, she sank back amid her \\npillows.  \\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: \"Now \\nyou go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I stay \\nhere tonight, and I shall sit up with little  miss myself. You and I must watch the \\ncase, and we must have none other to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not ask me. Think what you will. Do not fear to think even the most not-\\nimprobable. Goodnight.\"  \\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them \\nmight not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them, and when I \\nsaid it was Dr. Van Helsing\\'s wish that e ither he or I should  sit up, they asked \\nme quite piteously to intercede with the  \\'foreign gentleman\\'. I was much \\ntouched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am  weak at present, and \\nperhaps because it was on Lucy\\'s account, that their devotion was manifested. \\nFor over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman\\'s kindness. I got back here in time for a late dinner, went my rounds, all well, and set this \\ndown whilst waiting for sleep. It is coming.  \\n11 September.--This afternoon I we nt over to Hillingham. Found Van \\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much  better. Shortly after I had arrived, a \\nbig parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with much \\nimpressment, assumed, of course, and s howed a great bundle of white flowers.  \\n\"These are for you, Miss Lucy,\" he said.  \\n\"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\"  \\n\"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.\" Here \\nLucy made a wry face. \"Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in \\nnauseous form, so you need not snub th at so charming nose, or I shall point out \\nto my friend Arthur what woes he ma y have to endure in seeing so much \\nbeauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put \\nhim in your window, I make pretty wreath,  and hang him round your neck, so \\nyou sleep well. Oh, yes! They, like the lotus flower, make your trouble \\nforgotten. It smell so like the waters of  Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that \\nthe Conquistadores sought for in the Fl oridas, and find him all too late.\"  \\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and \\nsmelling them. Now she threw them down saying, with half laughter, and half \\ndisgust,  \\n\"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these \\nflowers are only common garlic.\"  \\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his \\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting,  \\n\"No trifling with me! I never jest! Ther e is grim purpose in what I do, and \\nI warn you that you do not thwart me. Ta ke care, for the sake of others if not \\nfor your own.\" Then seeing poor Lucy s cared, as she might well be, he went on \\nmore gently, \"Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good, \\nbut there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers. See, I place them \\nmyself in your room. I make myself the  wreath that you are to wear. But hush! \\nNo telling to others that make so inqu isitive questions. We must obey, and \\nsilence is a part of obedience, and ob edience is to bring you strong and well \\ninto loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still a while. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room  with my garlic, which is all the way \\nfrom Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpo ol raise herb in his glass houses all \\nthe year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\"  \\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor\\'s actions \\nwere certainly odd and n ot to be found in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of. \\nFirst he fastened up the windows and latched them  securely. Next, taking a \\nhandful of the flowers, he rubbed them a ll over the sashes, as though to ensure \\nthat every whiff of air that might get in w ould be laden with the garlic smell. \\nThen with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in th e same way. It all seemed grotesque to \\nme, and presently I said, \"Well, Professor,  I know you always have a reason for \\nwhat you do, but this certainly puzzles me . It is well we have no sceptic here, \\nor he would say that you were working some  spell to keep out an evil spirit.\"  \\n\"Perhaps I am!\" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which \\nLucy was to wear round her neck.  We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she \\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The \\nlast words he said to her were,  \\n\"Take care you do not disturb it, and even  if the room feel close, do not \\ntonight open the window  or the door.\"  \\n\"I promise,\" said Lucy. \"And thank yo u both a thousand times for all your \\nkindness to me! Oh, what have I done  to be blessed with such friends?\"  \\nAs we left the house in my fly, w hich was waiting, Van Helsing said, \\n\"Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want, two nights of travel, much \\nreading in the day between, and much an xiety on the day to follow, and a night \\nto sit up, without to wink.  Tomorrow in the morning early you call for me, and \\nwe come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my \\'spell\\' \\nwhich I have work. Ho, ho!\"  \\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two \\nnights before and with the baneful result , felt awe and vague terror. It must \\nhave been my weakness that made me hesi tate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it \\nall the more, like unshed tears.  \\nCHAPTER 11  \\nLUCY WESTENRA\\'S DIARY  \\n12 Septem\\nber.--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr. Van \\nHelsing. I wonder why he was so anxious  about these flowers. He positively \\nfrightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he  must have been right, for I feel \\ncomfort from them already. Somehow, I do  not dread being al one tonight, and I \\ncan go to sleep without fear. I shall no t mind any flapping outside the window. \\nOh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late, the pain \\nof sleeplessness, or the pa in of the fear of slee p, and with such unknown \\nhorrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads, to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings \\nnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am tonight, hoping fo r sleep, and lying \\nlike Ophelia in the play, with \\'virgin cr ants and maiden strewments.\\' I never \\nliked garlic before, but toni ght it is delightful! There is  peace in its smell. I feel \\nsleep coming already. G oodnight, everybody.   \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n13 September.--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing,  as usual, up \\nto time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took \\nhis bag, which he always brings with him now.  \\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at \\neight o\\'clock. It was a lovely morning. The bright sunshine and all the fresh \\nfeeling of early autumn seemed like th e completion of nature\\'s annual work. \\nThe leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, b ut had not yet begun \\nto drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of \\nthe morning room. She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said,  \\n\"You will be glad to kn ow that Lucy is better. The dear child is still asleep. \\nI looked into her room and saw her, but di d not go in, lest I should disturb her.\" \\nThe Professor smiled, and looked quite j ubilant. He rubbed his hands together, \\nand said, \"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working.\"  \\nTo which she replied, \"You must not ta ke all the credit to yourself, doctor. \\nLucy\\'s state this morning is due in part to me.\"  \\n\"How do you mean, ma\\'am?\" asked the Professor.  \\n\"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her \\nroom. She was sleeping soundly, so s oundly that even my coming did not wake \\nher. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, \\nstrong-smelling flowers about everywhe re, and she had actually a bunch of \\nthem round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the \\ndear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the \\nwindow to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.\"  \\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As \\nshe had spoken, I watched th e Professor\\'s face, and sa w it turn ashen gray. He \\nhad been able to retain his self-comma nd whilst the poor lady was present, for \\nhe knew her state and how mischievous  a shock would be. He actually smiled \\non her as he held open the door for he r to pass into her room. But the instant \\nshe had disappeared he pulled me, suddenl y and forcibly, into  the dining room \\nand closed the door.  Then, for the first time in my life,  I saw Van Helsing break down. He \\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms \\ntogether in a helpless way. Finally he  sat down on a chair,  and putting his \\nhands before his face, began to sob, wi th loud, dry sobs that seemed to come \\nfrom the very racking of his heart.  \\nThen he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \\n\"God! God! God!\" he said. \"What have we  done, what has this poor thing done, \\nthat we are so sore beset? Is there fa te amongst us still, send down from the \\npagan world of old, that such things mu st be, and in such way? This poor \\nmother, all unknowing, and all for the best  as she think, does such thing as lose \\nher daughter body and soul, and we must  not tell her, we must not even warn \\nher, or she die, then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of \\nthe devils against us!\"  \\nSuddenly he jumped to his feet. \"Come, \" he said, \"come, we must see and \\nact. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not. We must fight \\nhim all the same.\" He went to the hall d oor for his bag, and together we went \\nup to Lucy\\'s room.  \\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whils t Van Helsing went towards the bed. \\nThis time he did not start as he looke d on the poor face with the same awful, \\nwaxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.  \\n\"As I expected,\" he murmured, with th at hissing inspirat ion of his which \\nmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began \\nto set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of \\ntransfusion of blood. I had long ago recognized the ne cessity, and begun to take \\noff my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand. \"No!\" he said. \"Today \\nyou must operate. I shall provide. You ar e weakened already.\" As he spoke he \\ntook off his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeve.  \\nAgain the operation. Again the narcotic . Again some return of colour to \\nthe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathi ng of healthy sleep. This time I watched \\nwhilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.  \\nPresently he took an opportunity of te lling Mrs. Westenra that she must \\nnot remove anything from Lucy\\'s r oom without consulting him. That the \\nflowers were of medicinal value, and tha t the breathing of their odour was a \\npart of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next, and would send me word \\nwhen to come.  After another hour Lucy waked from  her sleep, fresh and bright and \\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.  \\nWhat does it all mean? I am beginni ng to wonder if my long habit of life \\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.  \\nLUCY WESTENRA\\'S DIARY  \\n17 September.--Four days an d nights of peace.  I am getting so strong again \\nthat I hardly know myself. It is as if  I had passed through some long nightmare, \\nand had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the \\nmorning around me. I have a dim half remembrance of long, anxious times of \\nwaiting and fearing, darkness in which ther e was not even the pain of hope to \\nmake present distress more poignant. A nd then long spells of oblivion, and the \\nrising back to life as a diver coming up th rough a great press of water. Since, \\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been wi th me, all this bad dreaming seems to \\nhave passed away. The noises that used  to frighten me out of my wits, the \\nflapping against the windows, the distant voices whi ch seemed so close to me, \\nthe harsh sounds that came from I know  not where and commanded me to do I \\nknow not what, have all ceased. I go to be d now without any fear of sleep. I do \\nnot even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful \\narrives for me every day from Haar lem. Tonight Dr. Van Helsing is going \\naway, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched. I am \\nwell enough to be left alone.  \\nThank God for Mother\\'s sake, and dear Arthur\\'s, and for all our friends \\nwho have been so kind! I sh all not even feel the chan ge, for last night Dr. Van \\nHelsing slept in his chair a lot of the  time. I found him asleep twice when I \\nawoke. But I did not fear to go to sleep aga in, although the bou ghs or bats or \\nsomething flapped almost angril y against the window panes.  \\nTHE PALL MALL GAZETTE 18 September.  \\nTHE ESCAPED WOLF PERILO US ADVENTURE OF OUR \\nINTERVIEWER  \\nINTERVIEW WITH THE KEEPER IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS  After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using \\nthe words \\'PALL MALL GAZETTE\\' as a so rt of talisman, I managed to find \\nthe keeper of the section of the Zoological Gardens in which the wolf \\ndepartment is included. Thomas Bild er lives in one of the cottages in the \\nenclosure behind the elephant house, a nd was just sitting down to his tea when \\nI found him. Thomas and his wife are ho spitable folk, elderly, and without \\nchildren, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average \\nkind, their lives must be pretty comfor table. The keeper would not enter on \\nwhat he called business until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. \\nThen when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said,  \\n\"Now, Sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You\\'ll excoose me \\nrefoosin\\' to talk of perfeshunal subjucts afore meals. I gives the wolves and the \\njackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them \\nquestions.\"  \\n\"How do you mean, ask th em questions?\" I queried, wishful to get him \\ninto a talkative humor.  \\n\"\\'Ittin\\' of them over the \\'ead with a pole is one way. Scratchin\\' of their ears \\nin another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals. I don\\'t so much mind the fust, the \\'ittin of the pole  part afore I chucks in their dinner, \\nbut I waits till they\\'ve \\'ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear scratchin\\'. Mind you,\" he adde d philosophically, \"there\\'s a deal of \\nthe same nature in us as in them theer an imiles. Here\\'s you a-comin\\' and arskin\\' \\nof me questions about my business, a nd I that grump-like that only for your \\nbloomin\\' \\'arf-quid I\\'d \\'a\\' seen you blowed fust \\'fore I\\'d answer. Not even when \\nyou arsked me sarcastic like  if I\\'d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you \\nmight arsk me questions. Without offence did I tell yer to go to \\'ell?\"  \\n\"You did.\"  \\n\"An\\' when you said you\\'d report me for usin\\' obscene language that was \\n\\'ittin\\' me over the \\'ead. But the \\'arf-quid made that all right. I weren\\'t a-goin\\' to \\nfight, so I waited for the food, and did with  my \\'owl as the wolves and lions and \\ntigers does. But, lor\\' love yer \\'art, now that the old \\'ooman has stuck a chunk of \\nher tea-cake in me, an\\' rinsed me out wi th her bloomin\\' old teapot, and I\\'ve lit \\nhup, you may scratch my ears for all you\\'re worth, a nd won\\'t even get a growl \\nout of me. Drive along with your questions . I know what yer a-comin\\' at, that \\n\\'ere escaped wolf.\"  \"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it \\nhappened, and when I know the facts I\\'ll get you to say what you consider was \\nthe cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end.\"  \\n\"All right, guv\\'nor. This \\'ere is about th e \\'ole story. That \\'ere wolf what we \\ncalled Bersicker was one of three gray ones that came from Norway to Jamrach\\'s, which we bought off him fo ur years ago. He was a nice well-\\nbehaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I\\'m more surprised at \\'im \\nfor wantin\\' to get out nor any other animil e in the place. But, there, you can\\'t \\ntrust wolves no more nor women.\"  \\n\"Don\\'t you mind him, Sir!\" broke in Mr s. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \"\\'E\\'s \\ngot mindin\\' the animiles so long that blest if he ain\\'t like a old wolf \\'isself! But \\nthere ain\\'t no \\'arm in \\'im.\"  \\n\"Well, Sir, it was about two hours after feedin\\' yesterday when I first hear \\nmy disturbance. I was makin\\' up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma \\nwhich is ill. But when I heard the yelpin \\' and \\'owlin\\' I kem away straight. There \\nwas Bersicker a-tearin\\' like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out. \\nThere wasn\\'t much people about that day,  and close at hand was only one man, \\na tall, thin chap, with a \\'ook nose and a pointed bear d, with a few white hairs \\nrunnin\\' through it. He had a \\'ard, cold lo ok and red eyes, and I took a sort of \\nmislike to him, for it seemed as if it was \\'im as they was hirritated at. He \\'ad white kid gloves on \\'is \\'ands, and he poin ted out the animiles to me and says, \\n\\'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.\\'  \\n\"\\'Maybe it\\'s you,\\' says I, for I did not li ke the airs as he give \\'isself. He \\ndidn\\'t get angry, as I \\'ope d he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, \\nwith a mouth full of white, sh arp teeth. \\'Oh no, they woul dn\\'t like me,\\' \\'e says.  \\n\"\\'Ow yes, they would,\\' says I, a-imita tin\\' of him. \\'They always like a bone \\nor two to clean their teeth on about tea time, which you \\'as a bagful.\\'  \\n\"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the  animiles see us a-talkin\\' they lay \\ndown, and when I went over to Bersicker he  let me stroke his ears same as ever. \\nThat there man kem over, and blessed b ut if he didn\\'t put in his hand and stroke \\nthe old wolf\\'s ears too!  \\n\"\\'Tyke care,\\' says I. \\'Bersicker is quick.\\'  \\n\"\\'Never mind,\\' he says. I\\'m used to \\'em!\\'  \"\\'Are you in the business yourself?\\' I says, tyking off my \\'at, for a man \\nwhat trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.  \\n\"\\'Nom,\\' says he, \\'not exactly in the business, but I \\'ave made pets of \\nseveral.\\' And with that he lifts his \\'at as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old \\nBersicker kep\\' a-lookin\\' arter \\'im till \\'e was out of sight, and then went and lay \\ndown in a corner and wouldn\\'t come hout the \\'ole hevening. Well, larst night, \\nso soon as the moon was hup, the wolves he re all began a-\\'owling. There warn\\'t \\nnothing for them to \\'owl at. There warn\\'t no one near, except some one that was \\nevidently a-callin\\' a dog some wheres out back of the ga rdings in the Park road. \\nOnce or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the \\'owling stopped. Just before twelve o\\'clock I just took a look round afore turnin\\' \\nin, an\\', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker\\'s cage I see the rails \\nbroken and twisted about and the cag e empty. And that\\'s all I know for \\ncerting.\"  \\n\"Did any one else see anything?\"  \\n\"One of our gard\\'ners was a-comin\\' \\'ome about that time from a \\'armony, \\nwhen he sees a big gray dog comin\\' out th rough the garding \\'edges. At least, so \\nhe says, but I don\\'t give much for it myself, for if he did \\'e never said a word \\nabout it to his missis when \\'e got \\'ome , and it was only after the escape of the \\nwolf was made known, and we had been up all night a-huntin\\' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein\\'  anything. My own belief was that the \\n\\'armony \\'ad got into his \\'ead.\"  \\n\"Now, Mr. Bilder, can yo u account in any way for the escape of the wolf?\"  \\n\"Well, Sir,\" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \"I think I can, but I \\ndon\\'t know as \\'ow you\\'d be satisfied with the theory.\"  \\n\"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from \\nexperience, can\\'t hazard a good guess at  any rate, who is even to try?\"  \\n\"Well then, Sir, I accounts for it this way. It seems to me that \\'ere wolf \\nescaped--simply because he wanted to get out.\"  \\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I \\ncould see that it had done service befo re, and that the whole explanation was \\nsimply an elaborate sell. I couldn\\'t c ope in badinage w ith the worthy Thomas, \\nbut I thought I knew a sure r way to his heart, so I sa id, \"Now, Mr. Bilder, we\\'ll consider that first half-sov ereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting \\nto be claimed when you\\'ve told me what you think will happen.\"  \\n\"Right y\\'are, Sir,\" he said briskly. \"Ye\\'ll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin\\' \\nof ye, but the old woman here winked at me , which was as much as telling me \\nto go on.\"  \\n\"Well, I never!\" said the old lady.  \\n\"My opinion is this: that \\'ere wolf is  a\\'idin\\' of, somewheres. The gard\\'ner \\nwot didn\\'t remember said he was a-gallopin\\' northward faster than a horse \\ncould go, but I don\\'t believe him, for, yer see, Sir, wolves don\\'t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein\\' built that way. Wolves is fine things in a \\nstorybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin\\' somethin\\' \\nthat\\'s more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But, Lor\\' bless you, in real  life a wolf is only a low creature, not \\nhalf so clever or bold as a good dog, and not half a quarter so much fight in \\'im. \\nThis one ain\\'t been used to fightin\\' or even to providin\\' for hisself, and more \\nlike he\\'s somewhere round the Park a\\'hidin\\' an\\' a\\'shiverin\\' of, and if he thinks at all, wonderin\\' where he is to get his breakfast from. Or maybe he\\'s got down \\nsome area and is in a coal cellar. My eye, won\\'t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shinin\\' at her ou t of the dark! If he can\\'t get food he\\'s \\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he ma y chance to light on a butcher\\'s shop in \\ntime. If he doesn\\'t, and some nursemaid goes out walkin\\' or orf with a soldier, \\nleavin\\' of the hinfant in the perambulator-- well, then I shouldn\\'t be surprised if \\nthe census is one babby the less. That\\'s all.\"  \\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up \\nagainst the window, and Mr . Bilder\\'s face doubled its natural length with \\nsurprise.  \\n\"God bless me!\" he said. \"If there ain\\'t old Bersicker come back by \\'isself!\"  \\nHe went to the door and opened it, a most unnecessar y proceeding it \\nseemed to me. I have always thought tha t a wild animal never looks so well as \\nwhen some obstacle of pronounced du rability is between us. A personal \\nexperience has intensified rathe r than diminished that idea.  \\nAfter all, however, there is nothing l ike custom, for neither Bilder nor his \\nwife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal itself was \\na peaceful and well-behaved as that fath er of all picture-wolves, Red Riding \\nHood\\'s quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade.  The whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The \\nwicked wolf that for a half a day had paralyzed London and set all the children \\nin town shivering in their shoes, was there  in a sort of penitent mood, and was \\nreceived and petted like a sort of vul pine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined \\nhim all over with most tender solicitude , and when he had finished with his \\npenitent said,  \\n\"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble. \\nDidn\\'t I say it all along? Here\\'s his head  all cut and full of broken glass. \\'E\\'s \\nbeen a-gettin\\' over some bloomin\\' wall or  other. It\\'s a shyme that people are \\nallowed to top their walls with broken b ottles. This \\'ere\\'s what comes of it. \\nCome along, Bersicker.\"  \\nHe took the wolf and loc ked him up in a cage, with  a piece of meat that \\nsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the el ementary conditions of the fatted calf, \\nand went off to report.  \\nI came off too, to report the only excl usive information that is given today \\nregarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  17 September.--I was engaged after din ner in my study posting up my \\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had \\nfallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the d oor was burst open, and in rushed my \\npatient, with his face dis torted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a \\nthing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent\\'s study is \\nalmost unknown.  \\nWithout an instant\\'s notice he made straight at me . He had a dinner knife \\nin his hand, and as I saw he was dangerou s, I tried to keep the table between us. \\nHe was too quick and too strong for me , however, for before I could get my \\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.  \\nBefore he could strike again, howeve r, I got in my right  hand and he was \\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wris t bled freely, and quite a little pool \\ntrickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, \\nand occupied myself binding up my wrist,  keeping a wary eye on the prostrate \\nfigure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention \\nto him, his employment positively sicken ed me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the bl ood which had fallen from my wounded \\nwrist. He was easily secured, and to my  surprise, went with the attendants quite \\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over  again, \"The bloo d is the life! The \\nblood is the life!\"  \\nI cannot afford to lose bloo d just at present. I have lo st too much of late for \\nmy physical good, and then the prolonge d strain of Lucy\\'s illness and its \\nhorrible phases is telling on me. I am ove r excited and weary, and I need rest, \\nrest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my \\nsleep. Tonight I could not well do without it.  \\nTELEGRAM, VAN HELSING, ANTW ERP, TO SEWARD, CARFAX  \\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given, delivered late by twenty-two \\nhours.)  \\n17 September.--Do not fail to be at Hill lingham tonight. If not watching all \\nthe time, frequently visit and see that flowers are as placed, very important, do \\nnot fail. Shall be with you as soon  as possible after arrival.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n18 September.--Just off train to Lond on. The arrival of Van Helsing\\'s \\ntelegram filled me with dismay. A w hole night lost, and I know by bitter \\nexperience what may happen in a night. Of course it is possible that all may be \\nwell, but what may have happened? Surely there is some horrible doom \\nhanging over us that every po ssible accident should thwart  us in all we try to do. \\nI shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy\\'s \\nphonograph.  \\nMEMORANDUM LEFT BY LUCY WESTENRA  \\n17 September, Night.--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one \\nmay by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact record of what took place tonight. I feel I am dying of weakness, an d have barely strength to \\nwrite, but it must be done if I die in the doing.  \\nI went to bed as usual, taking care tha t the flowers were placed as Dr. Van \\nHelsing directed, and soon fell asleep.  \\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that \\nsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I \\nknow so well. I was not afra id, but I did wish that Dr . Seward was in the next \\nroom, as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be, so that I might have called him. I \\ntried to sleep, but I could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it. So, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out, \"Is there anybody there?\" There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and \\nso closed my door again. Then outside in  the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl \\nlike a dog\\'s, but more fierce and deeper . I went to the wind ow and looked out, \\nbut could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its \\nwings against the window. So I went b ack to bed again, but determined not to \\ngo to sleep. Presently the door opene d, and mother looked in. Seeing by my \\nmoving that I was not asleep, she came in and sat by me. She said to me even \\nmore sweetly and softly than her wont,  \\n\"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all \\nright.\"  \\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and \\nsleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me. She did not take \\noff her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go \\nback to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers the flapping \\nand buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a l ittle frightened, \\nand cried out, \"What is that?\"  \\nI tried to pacify her, and at last su cceeded, and she lay quiet. But I could \\nhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the howl \\nagain out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, \\nand a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. Th e window blind blew back \\nwith the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was \\nthe head of a great, gaunt gray wolf.  \\nMother cried out in a fright, and str uggled up into a sitting posture, and \\nclutched wildly at anyth ing that would help her. Amongst other things, she \\nclutched the wreath of flowers that Dr . Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, \\npointing at the wolf, and there was a stra nge and horrible gurgling in her throat. \\nThen she fell over, as if struck with ligh tning, and her head hit my forehead and \\nmade me dizzy for a moment or two.  \\nThe room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the \\nwindow, but the wolf drew his head back , and a whole myriad of little specks \\nseems to come blowing in through the broken wi ndow, and wheeling and \\ncircling round like the pillar of dust tha t travellers describe when there is a \\nsimoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but th ere was some spell upon me, and dear \\nMother\\'s poor body, which seemed to grow cold already, for her dear heart had \\nceased to beat, weighed me down, and I remembered no more for a while.  \\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered \\nconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a pa ssing bell was toll ing. The dogs all \\nround the neighbourhood were howling, and in our shrubbery, seemingly just \\noutside, a nightingale  was singing. I was dazed an d stupid with pain and terror \\nand weakness, but the sound of the nigh tingale seemed like the voice of my \\ndead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened \\nthe maids, too, for I could hear their ba re feet pattering outside my door. I \\ncalled to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and \\nwhat it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in \\nthrough the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body \\nof my dear mother, and laid her, covere d up with a sheet, on the bed after I had \\ngot up. They were all so frightened a nd nervous that I directed them to go to \\nthe dining room and each have a glass of wine. The door flew open for an \\ninstant and closed again. The maids sh rieked, and then went in a body to the \\ndining room, and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother\\'s breast. When \\nthey were there I remembered what Dr . Van Helsing had told me, but I didn\\'t \\nlike to remove them, and besides, I would ha ve some of the servants to sit up \\nwith me now. I was surprised that the ma ids did not come back. I called them, \\nbut got no answer, so I went to the dining room to look for them.  \\nMy heart sank when I saw what had ha ppened. They all four lay helpless \\non the floor, breathing heavily. The decante r of sherry was on the table half full, \\nbut there was a queer, acrid smell about.  I was suspicious, and examined the \\ndecanter. It smelt of laudanum, and look ing on the sideboard, I found that the \\nbottle which Mother\\'s doctor uses for he r--oh! did use--was empty. What am I \\nto do? What am I to do? I am back in the  room with Mother. I cannot leave her, \\nand I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. \\nAlone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf \\nthrough the broken window.  The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the \\nwindow, and the lights burn blue and dim . What am I to do? God shield me \\nfrom harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find \\nit when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It is time that I go too. \\nGoodbye, dear Arthur, if I should not su rvive this night. God keep you, dear, \\nand God help me!  \\nCHAPTER 12  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n18 September.--I drove at once to Hill ingham and arrived early. Keeping \\nm\\ny cab at the gate, I went up the avenue  alone. I knocked gently and rang as \\nquietly as possible, for I f eared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to \\nonly bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked \\nand rang again, still no answer. I cursed  the laziness of the servants that they \\nshould lie abed at such an hour, for it was now ten o\\'clock, and so rang and \\nknocked again, but more impatiently, bu t still without response. Hitherto I had \\nblamed only the servants, but now a terr ible fear began to assail me. Was this \\ndesolation but another link in the chai n of doom which seemed drawing tight \\nround us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I know \\nthat minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if \\nshe had had again one of those frightful relapses, and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.  \\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and \\nlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse\\'s feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds \\nlater I met Van Helsing runn ing up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out, \\n\"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you not \\nget my telegram?\"  \\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his \\ntelegram early in the morning, and had no t a minute in coming here, and that I \\ncould not make any one in the house hear  me. He paused and raised his hat as \\nhe said solemnly, \"Then I fear we are too late. God\\'s will be done!\"  \\nWith his usual recuperative energy, he went on, \"Come. If there be no way \\nopen to get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\"  We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen \\nwindow. The Professor took a small surgic al saw from his case, and handing it \\nto me, pointed to the iron bars which guard ed the window. I attacked them at \\nonce and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife \\nwe pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped \\nthe Professor in, and followed him. Ther e was no one in the kitchen or in the \\nservants\\' rooms, which were close at ha nd. We tried all the rooms as we went \\nalong, and in the dining room , dimly lit by rays of l ight through the shutters, \\nfound four servant women lying on the fl oor. There was no need to think them \\ndead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room \\nleft no doubt as to their condition.  \\nVan Helsing and I looked at each othe r, and as we moved away he said, \\n\"We can attend to them later.\" Then we  ascended to Lucy\\'s room. For an \\ninstant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we \\ncould hear. With white faces and trembling  hands, we opened the door gently, \\nand entered the room.  \\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and \\nher mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, \\nthe edge of which had been blown b ack by the drought through the broken \\nwindow, showing the drawn, white, face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By \\nher side lay Lucy, with face white and st ill more drawn. Th e flowers which had \\nbeen round her neck we found upon her mother\\'s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which  we had noticed before, but looking \\nhorribly white and mangled. Without a wor d the Professor bent over the bed, \\nhis head almost touching poor Lucy\\'s br east. Then he gave a quick turn of his \\nhead, as of one who listens,  and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me, \"It is not \\nyet too late! Quick! Quic k! Bring the brandy!\"  \\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, ta king care to smell and taste it, lest \\nit, too, were drugged like  the decanter of sherry which I found on the table. The \\nmaids were still breathing, but more rest lessly, and I fancied that the narcotic \\nwas wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He \\nrubbed the brandy, as on another o ccasion, on her lips and gums and on her \\nwrists and the palms of her hands. He said  to me, \"I can do this, all that can be \\nat the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet \\ntowel, and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This \\npoor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we \\ncan do anything more.\"  I went at once, and found little diffi culty in waking three of the women. \\nThe fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more \\nstrongly so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep.  \\nThe others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them \\nthey cried and sobbed in a hysterical ma nner. I was stern with them, however, \\nand would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, \\nand if they delayed they would sacrif ice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying \\nthey went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. \\nFortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried Lu cy out as she was and placed her in it. \\nWhilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One \\nof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she \\nreturned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away  with the message, and, engrossed \\nwith our work, I clean forgot all about him.  \\nI never saw in all my experience the Pr ofessor work in such deadly earnest. \\nI knew, as he knew, that it was a sta nd-up fight with death,  and in a pause told \\nhim so. He answered me in a way tha t I did not understa nd, but with the \\nsternest look that his face could wear.  \\n\"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade \\naway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\" He went on with \\nhis work with, if possible, rene wed and more frenzied vigour.  \\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be \\nof some effect. Lucy\\'s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing\\'s face almost beamed, and \\nas we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to \\nme, \"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!\"  \\nWe took Lucy into another room, w hich had by now been prepared, and \\nlaid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.  \\nVan Helsing called in one of the wome n, and told her to st ay with her and \\nnot to take her eyes off her till we re turned, and then beckoned me out of the \\nroom.  \"We must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the \\nstairs. In the hall he opened the dining room door, and we passed in, he closing \\nthe door carefully behind him. The shutte rs had been opened, but the blinds \\nwere already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the \\nBritish woman of the lower classes alwa ys rigidly observes.  The room was, \\ntherefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van \\nHelsing\\'s sternness was somewhat reliev ed by a look of perplexity. He was \\nevidently torturing his mind about something, so I waite d for an instant, and he \\nspoke.  \\n\"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have \\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon,  or that poor girl\\'s life won\\'t be \\nworth an hour\\'s purchase. You are exhauste d already. I am exhausted too. I fear \\nto trust those women, even if they woul d have courage to submit. What are we \\nto do for some one who will open his veins for her?\"  \\n\"What\\'s the matter with me, anyhow?\"  \\nThe voice came from the sofa across the  room, and its tones brought relief \\nand joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris.  \\nVan Helsing started angril y at the first sound, bu t his face softened and a \\nglad look came into his eyes as I crie d out, \"Quincey Morris!\" and rushed \\ntowards him with outstretched hands.  \\n\"What brought you here?\" I cried as our hands met.  \\n\"I guess Art is the cause.\"  \\nHe handed me a telegram.--\\'Have not heard from Seward for three days, \\nand am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me \\nword how Lucy is. Do not delay.--Holmwood.\\'  \\n\"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell me \\nwhat to do.\"  \\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took  his hand, looking him straight in the \\neyes as he said, \"A brave man\\'s bloo d is the best thing on this earth when a \\nwoman is in trouble. You\\'re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work \\nagainst us for all he\\'s worth, but G od sends us men when we want them.\"  Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart to \\ngo through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her \\nmore than before, for though plenty of  blood went into her veins, her body did \\nnot respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. Her struggle \\nback into life was something frightful to see and hear. However, the action of \\nboth heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a sub-cutaneous \\ninjection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became a \\nprofound slumber. The Professor watc hed whilst I went downstairs with \\nQuincey Morris, and sent one  of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who \\nwere waiting.  \\nI left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to \\nget ready a good breakfast. Then a thou ght struck me, and I went back to the \\nroom where Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a \\nsheet or two of note paper in his ha nd. He had evidently read it, and was \\nthinking it over as he sat wi th his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim \\nsatisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solv ed. He handed me \\nthe paper saying only, \"It dropped from Lucy\\'s breast when we carried her to \\nthe bath.\"  \\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause \\nasked him, \"In God\\'s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she, mad, or \\nwhat sort of horrible danger is it?\" I was so bewildered that I did not know \\nwhat to say more. Van Hels ing put out his hand and to ok the paper, saying,  \\n\"Do not trouble abou t it now. Forget it for the pr esent. You sh all know and \\nunderstand it all in good tim e, but it will be later. And now what is it that you \\ncame to me to say?\" This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again.  \\n\"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act properly \\nand wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. \\nI am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know , and you know, and the other doctor who \\nattended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it \\nmyself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.\"  \\n\"Good, oh my friend John! Well thoug ht of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad \\nin the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her. One, two, \\nthree, all open their veins for her, besi des one old man. Ah, yes, I know, friend \\nJohn. I am not blind! I love you all the more for it! Now go.\"  In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him \\nthat Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy also had been ill,  but was now going \\non better, and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was \\ngoing, and he hurried me out,  but as I was going said,  \\n\"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to \\nourselves?\" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about the \\nregistration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.  \\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiti ng for me. I told him I would see him \\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still sleeping, \\nand the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expect ed her to wake before \\nlong and was afraid of fore-stalling na ture. So I went down to Quincey and \\ntook him into the breakfast room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and \\nwhich was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.  \\nWhen we were alone, he said to me, \"Jack Seward, I don\\'t want to shove \\nmyself in anywhere where I\\'ve no right to  be, but this is no ordinary case. You \\nknow I loved that girl and wanted to marry her, but although that\\'s all past and \\ngone, I can\\'t help feeling anxious about he r all the same. What is it that\\'s wrong \\nwith her? The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow he is, I can see that, said that time you two came into the room, that you must have another transfusion of \\nblood, and that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you \\nmedical men speak in camera, and that a man must not exp ect to know what \\nthey consult about in private.  But this is no common ma tter, and whatever it is, \\nI have done my part. Is not that so?\"  \\n\"That\\'s so,\" I said, and he went on.  \\n\"I take it that both you and Van Helsi ng had done already what I did today. \\nIs not that so?\"  \\n\"That\\'s so.\"  \"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his \\nown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pull ed down so quick \\nsince I was on the Pampas and had a mare  that I was fond of go to grass all in a \\nnight. One of those big bats that they ca ll vampires had got at her in the night, \\nand what with his gorge and the vein left  open, there wasn\\'t enough blood in \\nher to let her stand up, and I had to put a b ullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence,  Arthur was the first, is not that \\nso?\"  \\nAs he spoke the poor fellow looked te rribly anxious. He  was in a torture of \\nsuspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible \\nmystery which seemed to surround her inte nsified his pain. His very heart was \\nbleeding, and it took all the manhood of him , and there was a royal lot of it, too, \\nto keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I \\nmust not betray anything which the Prof essor wished kept secret, but already \\nhe knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not \\nanswering, so I answered in the same phrase.  \\n\"That\\'s so.\"  \\n\"And how long has this been going on?\"  \"About ten days.\"  \\n\"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that \\nwe all love has had put into her veins wi thin that time the blood of four strong \\nmen. Man alive, her whole body woul dn\\'t hold it.\" Then coming close to me, \\nhe spoke in a fierce half-whis per. \"What took it out?\"  \\nI shook my head. \"That,\" I said, \"is the  crux. Van Helsing is simply frantic \\nabout it, and I am at my wits\\' end. I can \\'t even hazard a guess. There has been a \\nseries of little circumstances which have  thrown out all our calculations as to \\nLucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay \\nuntil all be well, or ill.\"  \\nQuincey held out his hand. \"Count me in,\" he said. \"You and the \\nDutchman will tell me what to do, and I\\'ll do it.\"  \\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy\\'s first movement was to feel in \\nher breast, and to my surprise, prod uced the paper which Van Helsing had \\ngiven me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, \\nlest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eyes then lit on Van Helsing and on \\nme too, and gladdened. Then she looked round the room, and seeing where she \\nwas, shuddered. She gave a loud cry, an d put her poor thin hands before her \\npale face.  \\nWe both understood what was meant, that she had realized to the full her \\nmother\\'s death. So we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept \\nsilently and weakly for a long time. We tol d her that either or both of us would \\nnow remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards \\ndusk she fell into a doze. Here  a very odd thing occurred . Whilst still asleep she \\ntook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her. A ll the same, however, she we nt on with the action of \\ntearing, as though the material were stil l in her hands. Finally she lifted her \\nhands and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing \\nseemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.  \\n19 September.--All last night she slept f itfully, being always afraid to sleep, \\nand something weaker when  she woke from it. The Professor and I took in \\nturns to watch, and we never left he r for a moment unattended. Quincey Morris \\nsaid nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled \\nround and round the house.  \\nWhen the day came, its searching lig ht showed the ravages in poor Lucy\\'s \\nstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which \\nshe could take seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van \\nHelsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sl eeping and waking. \\nWhilst asleep she looked stronger, a lthough more haggard, and her breathing \\nwas softer. Her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, \\nwhich looked positively longer and sh arper than usual. When she woke the \\nsoftness of her eyes evidently change d the expression, for she looked her own \\nself, although a dying one. In the af ternoon she asked for Arthur, and we \\ntelegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.  \\nWhen he arrived it was nearly six o\\'c lock, and the sun was setting full and \\nwarm, and the red light streamed in thr ough the window and gave more colour \\nto the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply ch oking with emotion, \\nand none of us could speak. In the hours th at had passed, the fits of sleep, or the \\ncomatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the \\npauses when conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur\\'s presence, \\nhowever, seemed to act as a stimulant. She rallied a little, and spoke to him \\nmore brightly than she had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself \\ntogether, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of \\neverything.  \\nIt is now nearly one o\\'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her. I \\nam to relieve them in a quarter of an ho ur, and I am entering this on Lucy\\'s phonograph. Until six o\\'cloc k they are to try to rest. I fear that tomorrow will \\nend our watching, for the shock has been  too great. The poor child cannot rally. \\nGod help us all.  \\nLETTER MINA HARKER TO  LUCY WESTENRA  \\n(Unopened by her)  \\n17 September  My dearest Lucy,  \"It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You will \\npardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news. \\nWell, I got my husband back all right. When we arrived at Exeter there was a \\ncarriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. \\nHe took us to his house, where ther e were rooms for us all nice and \\ncomfortable, and we dined together. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said,  \\n\"\\'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity, and may every \\nblessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with love \\nand pride, seen you grow up. Now I wa nt you to make your home here with me. \\nI have left to me neither chick nor child.  All are gone, and in my will I have left \\nyou everything.\\' I cried, Lucy dear, as  Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. \\nOur evening was a very, very happy one.  \\n\"So here we are, installed in this  beautiful old house, and from both my \\nbedroom and the drawing room I can see the  great elms of the cathedral close, \\nwith their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral, and I can hear the rooks ov erhead cawing and caw ing and chattering \\nand chattering and gossipi ng all day, after the manne r of rooks--and humans. I \\nam busy, I need not tell you, arrangin g things and housekeeping. Jonathan and \\nMr. Hawkins are busy all day, for now tha t Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins \\nwants to tell him all about the clients.  \\n\"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a \\nday or two to see you, d ear, but I dare not go yet,  w i t h  s o  m u ch on my \\nshoulders, and Jonathan wants looking af ter still. He is beginning to put some \\nflesh on his bones again, but he was terri bly weakened by the long illness. Even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all \\ntrembling until I can coax him back to his  usual placidity. However, thank God, \\nthese occasions grow less frequent as the  days go on, and they will in time pass \\naway altogether, I trust. And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours. \\nWhen are you to be married, and where,  and who is to perform the ceremony, \\nand what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or private wedding? Tell me \\nall about it, dear, tell me all about everything, for there  is nothing which \\ninterests you which will no t be dear to me. Jonath an asks me to send his \\n\\'respectful duty\\', but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner \\nof the important firm Hawkins & Harker. And so, as you love me, and he loves \\nme, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply \\nhis \\'love\\' instead. Goodbye, my dearest Lucy, and blessings on you.  \\n\"Yours,  \\n\"Mina Harker\"  \\nREPORT FROM PATRICK HENNESSEY, MD, MRCSLK, QCPI, ETC, \\nETC, TO JOHN SEWARD, MD  \\n20 September  My dear Sir:  \\n\"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of \\neverything left in my charge. With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to \\nsay. He has had another outbreak, whic h might have had a dreadful ending, but \\nwhich, as it fortunately happened, wa s unattended with a ny unhappy results. \\nThis afternoon a carrier\\'s cart with tw o men made a call at the empty house \\nwhose grounds abut on ours, the hous e to which, you will remember, the \\npatient twice ran away. The me n stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, \\nas they were strangers.  \\n\"I was myself looking out of the st udy window, having a smoke after \\ndinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he pass ed the window of \\nRenfield\\'s room, the patient began to ra te him from within,  and called him all \\nthe foul names he could lay his tongue  to. The man, who seemed a decent \\nfellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \\'shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar\\', whereon our man accused him of  robbing him and wanting to murder \\nhim and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to noti ce, so he contented himself after \\nlooking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of place he had \\ngot to by saying, \\'Lor\\' bless yer, sir, I wouldn\\'t mind what was said to me in a \\nbloomin\\' madhouse. I pity ye and the guv\\' nor for havin\\' to live in the house \\nwith a wild beast like that.\\'  \\n\"Then he asked his way civilly enough , and I told him where the gate of \\nthe empty house was. He went away followed by threats and curses and \\nrevilings from our man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for \\nhis anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent \\nfits nothing of the kind had ever o ccurred. I found him, to my astonishment, \\nquite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the \\nincident, but he blandly aske d me questions as to what I meant, and led me to \\nbelieve that he was completely oblivious of  the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, \\nhowever, only another instance of his cun ning, for within half an hour I heard \\nof him again. This time he had broken out through the window  of his room, and \\nwas running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran \\nafter him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, \\nhaving on it some great wooden boxes.  The men were wiping their foreheads, \\nand were flushed in the face, as if w ith violent exercise. Before I could get up \\nto him, the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began \\nto knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment, \\nI believe he would have killed the ma n there and then. The other fellow jumped \\ndown and struck him over the head with th e butt end of his heavy whip. It was \\na horrible blow, but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and \\nstruggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You \\nknow I am no lightweight, and the others were both bur ly men. At first he was \\nsilent in his fighting, but as we began to master him, and the attendants were \\nputting a strait waistcoat on him, he bega n to shout, \\'I\\'ll frustrate them! They \\nshan\\'t rob me! They shan\\'t murder me by inches! I\\'ll fight for my Lord and \\nMaster!\\' and all sorts of similar inc oherent ravings. It was with very \\nconsiderable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the \\npadded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right, and he is going on well.  \\n\"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, \\nand promised to rain all the penaltie s of the law on us. Their threats were, \\nhowever, mingled with some sort of indir ect apology for the defeat of the two \\nof them by a feeble madman. They said that if it had not been for the way their \\nstrength had been spent in carrying and ra ising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him. They gave as another reason for their \\ndefeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the \\ndusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene \\nof their labors of any place of public en tertainment. I quite understood their \\ndrift, and after a stiff glass of strong grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light  of the attack, and swore that they \\nwould encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so \\'bloomin\\' good a bloke\\' as your correspo ndent. I took their names and addresses, \\nin case they might be needed. They are as follows: Jack Sm ollet, of Dudding\\'s \\nRents, King George\\'s Road, Great Wa lworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter \\nFarley\\'s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Gr een. They are both in the employment of \\nHarris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Compa ny, Orange Master\\'s Yard, Soho.  \\n\"I shall report to you a ny matter of interest occu rring here, and shall wire \\nyou at once if there is anything of importance.  \\n\"Believe me, dear Sir,  \\n\"Yours faithfully,  \"Patrick Hennessey.\"  \\nLETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA (Unopened by her)  \\n18 September  \"My dearest Lucy,  \\n\"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr . Hawkins has died very suddenly. \\nSome may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that \\nit really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or \\nmother, so that the dear old man\\'s dea th is a real blow to me. Jonathan is \\ngreatly distressed. It is no t only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, \\ngood man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated \\nhim like his own son and le ft him a fortune which to people of our modest \\nbringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jona than feels it on \\nanother account. He says the amount of  responsibility whic h it puts upon him \\nmakes him nervous. He begins to doubt hi mself. I try to cheer him up, and my \\nbelief in him helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon hi m the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his, a nature which enabled him by \\nour dear, good friend\\'s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years, should be \\nso injured that the very essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I \\nworry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happin ess, but Lucy dear, \\nI must tell someone, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful \\nappearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I \\ndread coming up to London, as  we must do that day after tomorrow, for poor \\nMr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to  be buried in the grave with his father. \\nAs there are no relations at all, Jonathan  will have to be chief mourner. I shall \\ntry to run over to see you, dearest, if  only for a few minutes. Forgive me for \\ntroubling you. With all blessings,  \\n\"Your loving  \\n\"Mina Harker\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  20 September.--Only resoluti on and habit can let me make an entry tonight. \\nI am too miserable, too low spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, \\nincluding life itself, that I would not care if  I heard this moment the flapping of \\nthe wings of the angel of death. And he  has been flapping those grim wings to \\nsome purpose of late, Lucy\\'s mother a nd Arthur\\'s father, and now Let me get \\non with my work.  \\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to \\ngo to rest also, but he refused at firs t. It was only when I told him that we \\nshould want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.  \\nVan Helsing was very kind to him. \"C ome, my child,\" he said. \"Come with \\nme. You are sick and weak , and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, \\nas well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone, for \\nto be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing room, where \\nthere is a big fire, and there are two sofa s. You shall lie on one, and I on the \\nother, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other,  even though we do not \\nspeak, and even if we sleep.\"  \\nArthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy\\'s face, \\nwhich lay in her pillow, almo st whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked around the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the \\nProfessor had carried out in this room, as  in the other, his purpose of using the \\ngarlic. The whole of the window sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy\\'s neck, \\nover the silk handkerchief which Van Hels ing made her keep on, was a rough \\nchaplet of the same odorous flowers.  \\nLucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, \\nfor the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, \\nseemed longer and sharper than they had b een in the morning. In particular, by \\nsome trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest.  \\nI sat down beside her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same \\nmoment there came a sort of dull flappi ng or buffeting at the window. I went \\nover to it softly, and peeped out by the co rner of the blind. There was a full \\nmoonlight, and I could see that the no ise was made by a great bat, which \\nwheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light, a lthough so dim, and every \\nnow and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, \\nI found that Lucy had move d slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers \\nfrom her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.  \\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. \\nShe took but a little, and that languidly. There did n ot seem to be with her now \\nthe unconscious struggle for life and st rength that had hitherto so marked her \\nillness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she \\npressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she \\ngot into that lethargic stat e, with the stertorous br eathing, she put the flowers \\nfrom her, but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mist ake about this, for in the long hours that followed, \\nshe had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many \\ntimes.  \\nAt six o\\'clock Van Helsing came to reli eve me. Arthur had then fallen into \\na doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy\\'s face I could \\nhear the hissing indraw of breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper. \"Draw \\nup the blind. I want ligh t!\" Then he bent down, a nd, with his face almost \\ntouching Lucy\\'s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the \\nsilk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back and I could hear his ejaculation, \"Mein Gott!\" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and \\nlooked, too, and as I noticed some qu eer chill came over me. The wounds on \\nthe throat had absolutely disappeared.  For fully five minutes Van Helsing stoo d looking at her, with his face at its \\nsternest. Then he turned to me and said  calmly, \"She is dying. It will not be \\nlong now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or \\nin her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last. He trusts \\nus, and we have promised him.\"  \\nI went to the dining room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but \\nwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in th rough the edges of the shutters he \\nthought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still \\nasleep, but told him as gently as I could th at both Van Helsing and I feared that \\nthe end was near. He covered his face w ith his hands, and slid down on his \\nknees by the sofa, where he remained, pe rhaps a minute, with his head buried, \\npraying, whilst his shou lders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and \\nraised him up. \"Come,\" I said, \"my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude. It will be best and easiest for her.\"  \\nWhen we came into Lucy\\'s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with \\nhis usual forethought, been putting ma tters straight and making everything look \\nas pleasing as possible. He had even brus hed Lucy\\'s hair, so that it lay on the \\npillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room she opened her \\neyes, and seeing him, whis pered softly, \"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you \\nhave come!\"  \\nHe was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. \"No,\" \\nhe whispered, \"not yet! Hold her hand, it will comfort her more.\"  \\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt be side her, and she looked her best, \\nwith all the soft lines matching the angeli c beauty of her eyes. Then gradually \\nher eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast heaved softly, \\nand her breath came and went like a tired child\\'s.  \\nAnd then insensibly there came the stra nge change which I had noticed in \\nthe night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft , voluptuous voice, su ch as I had never \\nheard from her lips, \"Arthur! Oh, my love , I am so glad you have come! Kiss \\nme!\"  \\nArthur bent eagerly over to kiss her, bu t at that instant Va n Helsing, who, \\nlike me, had been startled by her voi ce, swooped upon him, and catching him \\nby the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across \\nthe room.  \\n\"Not on your life!\" he said, \"not for your living soul and hers!\" And he \\nstood between them like a lion at bay.  \\nArthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do \\nor say, and before any impulse of vi olence could seize him he realized the \\nplace and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.  \\nI kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as \\nof rage flit like a shadow over her face. The sharp teeth clam ped together. Then \\nher eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.  \\nVery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out \\nher poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Hels ing\\'s great brown one, drawing it close \\nto her, she kissed it. \"My true friend, \" she said, in a faint voice, but with \\nuntellable pathos, \"My true friend, and his! Oh, guard him, and give me \\npeace!\"  \\n\"I swear it!\" he said solemnly, kneelin g beside her and holding up his hand, \\nas one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him, \"Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and ki ss her on the forehead, and only once.\"  \\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips, an d so they parted. Lucy\\'s eyes closed, \\nand Van Helsing, who had be en watching closely, took Arthur\\'s arm, and drew \\nhim away.  \\nAnd then Lucy\\'s breathing became ster torous again, and all at once it \\nceased.  \\n\"It is all over,\" said Van Helsing. \"She is dead!\"  \\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him  away to the drawing room, where he \\nsat down, and covered his face with his hands,  sobbing in a way that nearly \\nbroke me down to see.  \\nI went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and \\nhis face was sterner than ever. Some ch ange had come over her body. Death \\nhad given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some \\nof their flowing lines. Even the lips had lo st their deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the \\nharshness of death as lit tle rude as might be.  \\n\"We thought her dyin g whilst she slept, and sl eeping when she died.\"  \\nI stood beside Van Helsing,  and said, \"Ah well, poor  girl, there is peace for \\nher at last. It is the end!\"  \\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity, \"Not so, alas! Not so. It is \\nonly the beginning!\"  \\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he  only shook his head and answered, \\n\"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.\"  \\nCHAPTER 13  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--cont.  \\nThe f\\nuneral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her \\nmother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff was afflicted, or blessed, with \\nsomething of his own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional \\nway, when she had come out from the death chamber,  \\n\"She makes a very beautiful corpse, si r. It\\'s quite a privilege to attend on \\nher. It\\'s not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment!\"  \\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the \\ndisordered state of things in the househol d. There were no relatives at hand, \\nand as Arthur had to be back the next da y to attend at his father\\'s funeral, we \\nwere unable to notify any one who sh ould have been bidden. Under the \\ncircumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. \\nHe insisted upon looking over Lucy\\'s pa pers himself. I asked him why, for I \\nfeared that he, being a foreigner, m ight not be quite aware of English legal \\nrequirements, and so might in ignoran ce make some unnecessary trouble.  He answered me, \"I know, I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well \\nas a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you \\navoided the coroner. I have more than him  to avoid. There may be papers more, \\nsuch as this.\"  \\nAs he spoke he took from his pocke t book the memorandum which had \\nbeen in Lucy\\'s breast, and whic h she had torn in her sleep.  \\n\"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, \\nseal all her papers, and write him tonight.  For me, I watch here in the room and \\nin Miss Lucy\\'s old room all night, and I myse lf search for what may be. It is not \\nwell that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.\"  \\nI went on with my part of the work, an d in another half hour had found the \\nname and address of Mrs. Westenra\\'s so licitor and had written to him. All the \\npoor lady\\'s papers were in order. Expl icit directions regarding the place of \\nburial were given. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van \\nHelsing walked into the room, saying,  \\n\"Can I help you friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.\"  \\n\"Have you got what you looked for?\" I asked.  \\nTo which he replied, \"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to \\nfind, and find I have, all that there was,  only some letters and a few memoranda, \\nand a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say \\nnothing of them. I shall see that poor  lad tomorrow evening, and, with his \\nsanction, I shall use some.\"  \\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me, \"And now, friend \\nJohn, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to \\nrecuperate. Tomorrow we shall have much to do, but for the tonight there is no \\nneed of us. Alas!\"  \\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had \\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small chapelle \\nardente. There was a wild erness of beautiful white flowers, and death was \\nmade as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding sheet was laid over \\nthe face. When the Professor bent ov er and turned it ge ntly back, we both \\nstarted at the beauty before us. The ta ll wax candles showing a sufficient light \\nto note it well. All Lucy\\'s loveliness ha d come back to her in death, and the \\nhours that had passed, instead  of leaving traces of \\'decay\\'s effacing fingers\\', had but restored the beauty of life, till positive ly I could not believe my eyes that I \\nwas looking at a corpse.  \\nThe Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and \\nthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me, \"Remain till I return,\" \\nand left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box \\nwaiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers \\namongst the others on and around the bed.  Then he took from his neck, inside \\nhis collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the \\nsheet to its place, a nd we came away.  \\nI was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the \\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak.  \\n\"Tomorrow I want you to bring me, be fore night, a set of post-mortem \\nknives.\"  \\n\"Must we make an autopsy?\" I asked.  \\n\"Yes and no. I want to operate, but n ot what you think. Let me tell you \\nnow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out her heart. \\nAh! You a surgeon, and so shocked! Y ou, whom I have seen with no tremble \\nof hand or heart, do operations of life a nd death that make the rest shudder. Oh, \\nbut I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved he r, and I have not \\nforgotten it for is I that shall operate, and you must not help. I would like to do \\nit tonight, but for Arthur I must not. He will be free after his father\\'s funeral \\ntomorrow, and he will want to see her, to  see it. Then, when she is coffined \\nready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall unscrew \\nthe coffin lid, and shall do our operation , and then replace all, so that none \\nknow, save we alone.\"  \\n\"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body \\nwithout need? And if there is no neces sity for a post-mortem and nothing to \\ngain by it, no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge, why do it? \\nWithout such it is monstrous.\"  \\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite \\ntenderness, \"Friend John, I pity your p oor bleeding heart, and I love you the \\nmore because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden \\nthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you shall \\nknow, and bless me for knowin g, though they are not pleasant things. John, my \\nchild, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err, I am but man, but I believe in all I do. \\nWas it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came? \\nYes! Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his \\nlove, though she was dying, and snatched  him away by all my strength? Yes! \\nAnd yet you saw how she thanked me, w ith her so beautiful dying eyes, her \\nvoice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old ha nd and bless me? Yes! And \\ndid you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? \\nYes!  \\n\"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many \\nyears trust me. You have believe me w eeks past, when there be things so \\nstrange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend John. If \\nyou trust me not, then I must tell what I think, and that is not perhaps well. And \\nif I work, as work I shall, no matter trus t or no trust, withou t my friend trust in \\nme, I work with heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when I want all help and \\ncourage that may be!\" He paused a moment and went on solemnly, \"Friend \\nJohn, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, \\nthat so we work to a good end. Will you not have faith in me?\"  \\nI took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away, \\nand watched him go to his room and clos e the door. As I stood without moving, \\nI saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage, she had her back to me, \\nso did not see me, and go into the room where Lucy lay. The sight touched me. \\nDevotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she \\nnaturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she \\nloved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest.  \\nI must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van \\nHelsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and \\nsaid, \"You need not trouble about the knives. We shall not do it.\"  \\n\"Why not?\" I asked. For his solemni ty of the night before had greatly \\nimpressed me.  \\n\"Because,\" he said sternly, \"it is too late, or too early. See!\" Here he held \\nup the little golden crucifix.  \\n\"This was stolen in the night.\"  \\n\"How stolen,\" I asked in wond er, \"since you have it now?\"  \"Because I get it back from the wor thless wretch who stole it, from the \\nwoman who robbed the dead and the livi ng. Her punishment will surely come, \\nbut not through me. She knew not altogether what she did, and thus unknowing, \\nshe only stole. Now we must wait.\" He  went away on the word, leaving me \\nwith a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with.  \\nThe forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came, Mr. \\nMarquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial \\nand very appreciative of what we had d one, and took off our hands all cares as \\nto details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time \\nexpected sudden death from her heart, an d had put her affairs in absolute order. \\nHe informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy\\'s \\nfather which now, in default of direct issu e, went back to a dist ant branch of the \\nfamily, the whole estate, real and pe rsonal, was left absolutely to Arthur \\nHolmwood. When he had told us so much he went on,  \\n\"Frankly we did our best to prevent su ch a testamentary disposition, and \\npointed out certain contingencies that m ight leave her daughter either penniless \\nor not so free as she should be to act  regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed, \\nwe pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked \\nus if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had \\nthen no alternative but to accept. We we re right in principle , and ninety-nine \\ntimes out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the \\naccuracy of our judgment.  \\n\"Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of \\ndisposition would have  rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For \\nby her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of \\nthe property, and, even had she only surv ived her mother by five minutes, her \\nproperty would, in case there were no will, and a will was a practical \\nimpossibility in such a case, have been treated at her decease as under intestacy. \\nIn which case Lord Godalming, though so  dear a friend, would have had no \\nclaim in the world. And th e inheritors, being remote , would not be likely to \\nabandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I \\nassure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.\"  \\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part, in which he \\nwas officially interested, of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the \\nlimitations of sympathe tic understanding.  \\nHe did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see \\nLord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dr ead hostile criticism as to any of our \\nacts. Arthur was expected at five o\\'clock, so a little before that time we visited \\nthe death chamber. It was so in very  truth, for now both mother and daughter \\nlay in it. The undertaker, true to his craf t, had made the best display he could of \\nhis goods, and there was a mortuary ai r about the place that lowered our spirits \\nat once.  \\nVan Helsing ordered the former arrange ment to be adhered to, explaining \\nthat, as Lord Godalming was coming very  soon, it would be le ss harrowing to \\nhis feelings to see all that was le ft of his fiancee quite alone.  \\nThe undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself \\nto restore things to the c ondition in which we left the m the night before, so that \\nwhen Arthur came such shocks to his fee lings as we could avoid were saved.  \\nPoor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken. Even his stalwart \\nmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried \\nemotions. He had, I knew, been very ge nuinely and devotedly attached to his \\nfather, and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With me \\nhe was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous. But I \\ncould not help seeing that  there was some constraint with him. The professor \\nnoticed it too, and motioned  me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at \\nthe door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone  with her, but he \\ntook my arm and led me in, saying huskily,  \\n\"You loved her too, old fe llow. She told me all about it, and there was no \\nfriend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don\\'t know how to thank you \\nfor all you have done for her. I can\\'t think yet\"  \\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and \\nlaid his head on my breast, crying, \"O h, Jack! Jack! What shall I do? The \\nwhole of life seems gone from me all at  once, and there is nothing in the wide \\nworld for me to live for.\"  \\nI comforted him as well as I could. In  such cases men do not need much \\nexpression. A grip of the hand, the tigh tening of an arm over the shoulder, a \\nsob in unison, are expressions of sympa thy dear to a man\\'s heart. I stood still \\nand silent till his sobs died away, and th en I said softly to him, \"Come and look \\nat her.\"  \\nTogether we moved over to the bed, an d I lifted the lawn from her face. \\nGod! How beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat. And as for Arthur, he fell to \\ntrembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper, \"Jack, is she really dead?\"  \\nI assured him sadly that it was so, an d went on to suggest, for I felt that \\nsuch a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could \\nhelp, that it often happene d that after death faces become softened and even \\nresolved into their youthful beauty, that this was especially so when death had \\nbeen preceded by any acute or prolonge d suffering. I seemed to quite do away \\nwith any doubt, and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he tu rned aside. I told him that that must be goodbye, as \\nthe coffin had to be prepared, so he went  back and took her dead hand in his \\nand kissed it, and bent over and kiss ed her forehead. He came away, fondly \\nlooking back over his shoulder at her as he came.  \\nI left him in the drawing room, and told Van Helsing that he had said \\ngoodbye, so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker\\'s men to \\nproceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of \\nthe room again I told him of Arthur\\'s question, and he replied, \"I am not \\nsurprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\"  \\nWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the \\nbest of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner time , but when we had lit \\nour cigars he said, \"Lord\" but Arthur interrupted him.  \\n\"No, no, not that, fo r God\\'s sake! Not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir. I did \\nnot mean to speak offensively. It is only because my loss is so recent.\"  \\nThe Professor answered very sweetly,  \"I only used that name because I \\nwas in doubt. I must not ca ll you \\'Mr.\\' and I have grown to love you, yes, my \\ndear boy, to love you, as Arthur.\"  \\nArthur held out his hand, and took the  old man\\'s warmly. \"Call me what \\nyou will,\" he said. \"I hope I may always have the title of a friend. And let me \\nsay that I am at a loss for words to tha nk you for your goodness to my poor \\ndear.\" He paused a moment, and went on, \"I know that she understood your \\ngoodness even better than I do. And if I was rude or in an y way wanting at that \\ntime you acted so, you remember\"--the Professor nodded--\"you must forgive \\nme.\"  \\nHe answered with a grave kindness, \"I know it was hard for you to quite \\ntrust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand, and I take it that you do not, that you cannot, trust me  now, for you do not yet understand. And \\nthere may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot, and \\nmay not, and must not yet understand. Bu t the time will come when your trust \\nshall be whole and complete in me, a nd when you shall understand as though \\nthe sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to last \\nfor your own sake, and for the sake of others, and for her dear sake to whom I \\nswore to protect.\"  \\n\"And indeed, indeed, sir,\" said Arthur warmly. \"I shall in all ways trust \\nyou. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jack\\'s friend, \\nand you were hers. You shall do what you like.\"  \\nThe Professor cleared his throat a co uple of times, as though about to \\nspeak, and finally said, \"May  I ask you something now?\"  \\n\"Certainly.\"  \\n\"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\"  \"No, poor dear. I ne ver thought of it.\"  \\n\"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want \\nyou to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy\\'s papers and letters. Believe \\nme, it is no idle curiosity. I have a m otive of which, be sure, she would have \\napproved. I have them all here. I took them before we knew that all was yours, \\nso that no strange hand might touch them, no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep them, if I may. Even you may not see them yet, but I \\nshall keep them safe. No word shall be lost, and in the good time I shall give \\nthem back to you. It is a ha rd thing that I ask, but you will do it, will you not, \\nfor Lucy\\'s sake?\"  \\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self, \"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do \\nwhat you will. I feel that in saying this  I am doing what my  dear one would \\nhave approved. I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes.\"  \\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly, \"And you are right. There \\nwill be pain for us all, but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. \\nWe and you too, you most of all, dear  boy, will have to pa ss through the bitter \\nwater before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of h eart and unselfish, \\nand do our duty, and all will be well!\"  I slept on a sofa in Arthur\\'s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to bed \\nat all. He went to and fro, as if patrol ing the house, and wa s never out of sight \\nof the room where Lucy lay in her coffin,  strewn with the wild garlic flowers, \\nwhich sent through th e odour of lily and rose, a he avy, overpowering smell into \\nthe night.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n22 September.--In the train to Exeter . Jonathan sleeping. It seems only \\nyesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in \\nWhitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him, and \\nnow, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that \\nmay harm him. Some day he may ask me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty \\nin my shorthand, see what unexpected pros perity does for us, so it may be as \\nwell to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow.  \\nThe service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves \\nand the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London \\nagent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the \\nIncorporated Law Society. Jonathan a nd I stood hand in hand, and we felt that \\nour best and dearest friend was gone from us.  \\nWe came back to town quietly, taki ng a bus to Hyde Park Corner. \\nJonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat \\ndown. But there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and \\ndesolate to see so many empty chairs. It  made us think of the empty chair at \\nhome. So we got up and walked down Piccad illy. Jonathan was holding me by \\nthe arm, the way he used to in the old days before I went to school. I felt it very \\nimproper, for you can\\'t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to \\nother girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit. But it was \\nJonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn\\'t know a nybody who saw us, \\nand we didn\\'t care if they did, so on we walked. I was looking at a very \\nbeautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano\\'s, \\nwhen I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so  tight that he hurt me , and he said under \\nhis breath, \"My God!\"  I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may \\nupset him again. So I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that \\ndisturbed him.  \\nHe was very pale, and his eyes seem ed bulging out as, half in terror and \\nhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black \\nmoustache and pointed beard, who was al so observing the pretty girl. He was \\nlooking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view \\nof him. His face was not a good face. It wa s hard, and cruel, and sensual, and \\nbig white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were \\npointed like an animal\\'s. Jonathan kept st aring at him, till I was afraid he would \\nnotice. I feared he might ta ke it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked \\nJonathan why he was disturbed, and he  answered, evidentl y thinking that I \\nknew as much about it as he did, \"Do you see who it is?\"  \\n\"No, dear,\" I said. \"I don\\'t know him, who is it?\" His answer seemed to \\nshock and thrill me, for it was said as if  he did not know that it was me, Mina, \\nto whom he was speaking. \"It is the man himself!\"  \\nThe poor dear was evidently terrified at something, very greatly terrified. I \\ndo believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would \\nhave sunk down. He kept staring. A man came out of the shop with a small \\nparcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off. The dark man kept his eyes \\nfixed on her, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the \\nsame direction, and hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, \\nas if to himself,  \\n\"I believe it is the Count, but he ha s grown young. My God, if this be so! \\nOh, my God! My God! If only I knew! If only I knew!\" He was distressing \\nhimself so much that I feared to keep  his mind on the subject by asking him \\nany questions, so I remained silent. I dr ew away quietly, and he, holding my \\narm, came easily. We walked a little fu rther, and then went in and sat for a \\nwhile in the Green Park. It was a ho t day for autumn, and there was a \\ncomfortable seat in a shady place. Afte r a few minutes\\' staring at nothing, \\nJonathan\\'s eyes closed, and he went quic kly into a sleep, with his head on my \\nshoulder. I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In \\nabout twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully,  \\n\"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude. \\nCome, and we\\'ll have a cup of tea somewhere.\"  He had evidently forgotten all about th e dark stranger, as in his illness he \\nhad forgotten all that this episode had re minded him of. I don\\'t like this lapsing \\ninto forgetfulness. It may ma ke or continue some injury  to the brain. I must not \\nask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good, but I must somehow learn the \\nfacts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I must open the \\nparcel, and know what is written. Oh, J onathan, you will, I know, forgive me if \\nI do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.  \\nLater.--A sad homecoming in every way,  the house empty of the dear soul \\nwho was so good to us. Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of \\nhis malady, and now a telegram from Va n Helsing, whoever he may be. \"You \\nwill be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy \\ndied the day before yesterday. They were both buried today.\"  \\nOh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! Poor \\nLucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us ! And poor, poor Ar thur, to have lost \\nsuch a sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our troubles.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY-CONT.  22 September.--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken \\nQuincey Morris with him. What a fine fe llow is Quincey! I believe in my heart \\nof hearts that he suffered as much abou t Lucy\\'s death as any of us, but he bore \\nhimself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like \\nthat, she will be a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, \\nhaving a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes to Amsterdam tonight, but \\nsays he returns tomorrow night, that he  only wants to make some arrangements \\nwhich can only be made personally. He is  to stop with me then, if he can. He \\nsays he has work to do in London whic h may take him some time. Poor old \\nfellow! I fear that the strain of the pa st week has broken down even his iron \\nstrength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible \\nrestraint on himself. When it was all ove r, we were standing beside Arthur, \\nwho, poor fellow, was speaki ng of his part in the operation where his blood had \\nbeen transfused to his Lucy\\'s veins. I could see Van Helsing\\'s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt sinc e then as if they two had \\nbeen really married, and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us \\nsaid a word of the other operations, an d none of us ever shall. Arthur and \\nQuincey went away together to the stat ion, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of \\nhysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it \\nwas only his sense of humor asserting it self under very terrible conditions. He \\nlaughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see \\nus and misjudge. And then he cried, till he laughed agai n, and laughed and \\ncried together, just as a wo man does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a \\nwoman under the circumstances, but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his \\nface grew grave and stern again I asked him why his  mirth, and why at such a \\ntime. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said,  \\n\"Ah, you don\\'t comprehend, friend John.  Do not think that I am not sad, \\nthough I laugh. See, I have cried even  when the laugh did choke me. But no \\nmore think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who  knock at your door and say, \\'May I \\ncome in?\\' is not true laughter. No! He is  a king, and he come when and how he \\nlike. He ask no person, he choose no time of suitability. He say, \\'I am here.\\' Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl. I give \\nmy blood for her, though I am old and worn. I give my time, my skill, my sleep. I let my other sufferers want that she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave, laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say \\'Thud, thud!\\' to my heart, till it send back the blood from my \\ncheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy, th at dear boy, so of the age of mine \\nown boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same.  \\n\"There, you know now why I love him so . And yet when he say things that \\ntouch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as \\nto no other man, not even you, friend  John, for we are more level in \\nexperiences than father and son, yet even at such a moment King Laugh he \\ncome to me and shout and bellow in my ear, \\'Here I am! Here I am!\\' till the \\nblood come dance back and bring some of  the sunshine that he carry with him \\nto my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange  world, a sad world, a world full of \\nmiseries, and woes, and troubles. And yet when King Laugh come, he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall, all dance together to the music that \\nhe make with that smileless mouth of him . And believe me, friend John, that he \\nis good to come, and kind. Ah, we me n and women are like ropes drawn tight \\nwith strain that pull us different ways. Then  tears come, and like the rain on the \\nropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again, and \\nwe bear to go on with our labor, what it may be.\"  \\nI did not like to wound him by pretendi ng not to see his id ea, but as I did \\nnot yet understand the cause of his laug hter, I asked him. As he answered me \\nhis face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone,  \\n\"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all,  this so lovely lady garlanded with \\nflowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she were \\ntruly dead, she laid in that so fine ma rble house in that lonely churchyard, \\nwhere rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and \\nwhom she loved, and that sacred bell goin g \\'Toll! Toll! Toll!\\' so sad and slow, \\nand those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read \\nbooks, and yet all the time their eyes neve r on the page, and all of us with the \\nbowed head. And all for what? Sh e is dead, so! Is it not?\"  \\n\"Well, for the life of me, Professor,\" I said, \"I can\\'t see an ything to laugh at \\nin all that. Why, your expres sion makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even \\nif the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble? Why his \\nheart was simply breaking.\"  \\n\"Just so. Said he not that the transfusio n of his blood to her veins had made \\nher truly his bride?\"  \\n\"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.\"  \\n\"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then what \\nabout the others? Ho, ho! Then this so  sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, \\nwith my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church\\'s law, though no wits, all \\ngone, even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.\"  \\n\"I don\\'t see where the joke comes in ther e either!\" I said, and I did not feel \\nparticularly pleased with him for saying  such things. He laid his hand on my \\narm, and said,  \\n\"Friend John, forgive me if  I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when \\nit would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could \\nhave looked into my  heart then when I want to laug h, if you could have done so \\nwhen the laugh arrived, if you could do  so now, when King Laugh have pack \\nup his crown, and all that is to him, for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all.\"  I was touched by the tenderness of  his tone, and asked why.  \\n\"Because I know!\"  \\nAnd now we are all scattered, and for many a long day loneliness will sit \\nover our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy  lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly \\ndeath house in a lonely churchyard, away  from teeming London, where the air \\nis fresh, and the sun rises over Hampst ead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of \\ntheir own accord.  \\nSo I can finish this diary,  and God only know s if I shall ever begin another. \\nIf I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different people and \\ndifferent themes, for here at the end, where the romance of my life is told, ere I \\ngo back to take up the thread of my lif e-work, I say sadly and without hope, \\n\"FINIS\".  \\nTHE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER A HAMPSTEAD \\nMYSTERY  \\nThe neighborhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series \\nof events which seem to run on lines pa rallel to those of what was known to the \\nwriters of headlines as \"The Kensington Horror,\" or \"The Stabbing Woman,\" or \\n\"The Woman in Black.\" During the past two or three days several cases have \\noccurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from \\ntheir playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to \\ngive any properly intelligible account of  themselves, but the consensus of their \\nexcuses is that they had been with a \"bloof er lady.\" It has always been late in \\nthe evening when they ha ve been missed, and on tw o occasions the children \\nhave not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally \\nsupposed in the neighborhood  that, as the first child missed gave as his reason \\nfor being away that a \"bloofer lady\" ha d asked him to come for a walk, the \\nothers had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more \\nnatural as the favourite game of the litt le ones at present is  luring each other \\naway by wiles. A correspondent writes us  that to see some of the tiny tots \\npretending to be the \"bloofer lady\" is supremely funny. Some of our \\ncaricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by \\ncomparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general \\nprinciples of human nature that the \"bloof er lady\" should be th e popular role at \\nthese al fresco performances. Our co rrespondent naively says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winn ingly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little \\nchildren pretend, and even imagine themselves, to be.  \\nThere is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the \\nchildren, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or \\nwounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a \\nsmall dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. \\nThe police of the division have been in structed to keep a sharp lookout for \\nstraying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, \\nand for any stray dog which may be about.  \\nTHE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER EXTRA SPECIAL  \\nTHE HAMPSTEAD HORROR  \\nANOTHER CHILD INJURED  \\nTHE \"BLOOFER LADY\"  \\nWe have just received intelligence that  another child, missed last night, \\nwas only discovered late in the morning u nder a furze bush at the Shooter\\'s Hill \\nside of Hampstead Heath, which is perhaps,  less frequented than the other parts. \\nIt has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases. It \\nwas terribly weak, and looked quite emaci ated. It too, when partially restored, \\nhad the common story to tell of being lured away by the \"bloofer lady\".  \\nCHAPTER 14  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n23 Septem\\nber.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that he \\nhas plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible things, and oh, \\nI am rejoiced that he is not now weighe d down with the res ponsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to \\nsee my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all \\nways with the duties that come upon him. He will be away all day till late, for \\nhe said he could not lunch at home. My household work is done, so I shall take \\nhis foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it.  \\n24 September.--I hadn\\'t the h eart to write last night, that terrible record of \\nJonathan\\'s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered, whether it be \\ntrue or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth in it at all. Did he get his \\nbrain fever, and then write all those terri ble things, or had he some cause for it \\nall? I suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him. And \\nyet that man we saw yesterday! He seemed  quite certain of him, poor fellow! I \\nsuppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of \\nthought.  \\nHe believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedding day he said \\n\"Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep \\nor awake, mad or sane\" There seems to be through it all some thread of \\ncontinuity. That fearful Count was co ming to London. If it should be, and he \\ncame to London, with its teeming millions There may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from it. I shall be prepared. I shall get my \\ntypewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for \\nother eyes if required. And if it be wante d, then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor \\nJonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be \\ntroubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets over the \\nnervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and \\nfind out things, and see how I may comfort him.  \\nLETTER, VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER  \\n24 September  (Confidence)  \"Dear Madam,  \"I pray you to pardon my writing, in tha t I am so far friend as that I sent to \\nyou sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra\\'s death. By the kindness of Lord \\nGodalming, I am empowered to read he r letters and papers, for I am deeply \\nconcerned about certain matters vitally impo rtant. In them I find some letters \\nfrom you, which show how great friends you were and how you love her. Oh, \\nMadam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is for others\\' good that I \\nask, to redress great wrong, and to lift much and terrible troubles, that may be \\nmore great than you can know. May it be that I see you? You can trust me. I am \\nfriend of Dr. John Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it priv ate for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to \\nsee you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your pardon, Madam. I have read your letters to po or Lucy, and know \\nhow good you are and how your husband su ffer. So I pray you, if it may be, \\nenlighten him not, least it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.  \\n\"VAN HELSING\"  \\nTELEGRAM, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING  \\n25 September.--Come today by quarter pa st ten train if you can catch it. \\nCan see you any time you call.  \\n\"WILHELMINA HARKER\"  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n25 September.--I cannot he lp feeling terr ibly excited as the time draws \\nnear for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it will throw \\nsome light upon Jonathan\\'s sad experience , and as he attended poor dear Lucy \\nin her last illness, he can tell me all abo ut her. That is the reason of his coming. \\nIt is concerning Lucy and her sleep-wal king, and not about Jonathan. Then I \\nshall never know the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets \\nhold of my imagination and tinges everyt hing with something of its own colour. \\nOf course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my \\nown affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cli ff, and that I knew all about it, and now he wants \\nme to tell him what I know, so that he may understand. I hope I did right in not \\nsaying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra. I should never forgive myself if any act \\nof mine, were it even a negative one, br ought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope \\ntoo, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me . I have had so much trouble and \\nanxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.  \\nI suppose a cry does us all good at tim es, clears the air as other rain does. \\nPerhaps it was reading the journal yest erday that upset me, and then Jonathan \\nwent away this morning to stay away fr om me a whole day and night, the first \\ntime we have been parted since our ma rriage. I do hope the dear fellow will \\ntake care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him. It is two o\\'clock, \\nand the doctor will be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan\\'s journal \\nunless he asks me. I am so glad I have typewritten out my own journal, so that, \\nin case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him. It will save much questioning.  \\nLater.--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all \\nmakes my head whirl round. I feel like one in a dream. Can it be  all possible, or \\neven a part of it? If I had not read Jo nathan\\'s journal first, I should never have \\naccepted even a possibility. Poor, poor , dear Jonathan! How he must have \\nsuffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it. But it may be even a consolation and a he lp to him, terrible \\nthough it be and awful in its  consequences, to know for certain that his eyes \\nand ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is \\nthe doubt which haunts him, that when the doubt is re moved, no matter which, \\nwaking or dreaming, may prove the truth, he will be mo re satisfied and better \\nable to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever \\none if he is Arthur\\'s friend and Dr. Seward\\'s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he is \\ngood and kind and of a noble nature. Wh en he comes tomorrow I shall ask him \\nabout Jonathan. And then, ple ase God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a \\ngood end. I used to think I would like to practice interviewing. Jonathan\\'s \\nfriend on \"The Exeter News\" told him that memory is everything in such work, that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if \\nyou had to refine some of it afterwards. He re was a rare interview. I shall try to \\nrecord it verbatim.  \\nIt was half-past two o\\'clock when the knock came. I took my courage a \\ndeux mains and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and \\nannounced \"Dr. Van Helsing\".  I rose and bowed, and he came tow ards me, a man of medium weight, \\nstrongly built, with his shoulders set b ack over a broad, deep chest and a neck \\nwell balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise of the head \\nstrikes me at once as indicative of though t and power. The head is noble, well-\\nsized, broad, and large behind the ears.  The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, \\nsquare chin, a large resolute, mobile mo uth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, \\nbut with quick, sensitive nostrils, that se em to broaden as the big bushy brows \\ncome down and the mouth tightens. The fore head is broad and fine, rising at \\nfirst almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide \\napart, such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but \\nfalls naturally back and to the sides. Big,  dark blue eyes are set widely apart, \\nand are quick and tender or stern w ith the man\\'s moods. He said to me,  \\n\"Mrs. Harker, is it not?\" I bowed assent.  \\n\"That was Miss Mina Murray?\" Again I assented.  \\n\"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child \\nLucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead that I come.\"  \\n\"Sir,\" I said, \"you could have no be tter claim on me than that you were a \\nfriend and helper of Lucy Westenra.\" And I held out my hand. He took it and \\nsaid tenderly,  \\n\"Oh, Madam Mina, I know that the fr iend of that poor little girl must be \\ngood, but I had yet to learn\" He finis hed his speech with a courtly bow. I \\nasked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began.  \\n\"I have read your letters to Miss Lu cy. Forgive me, but I had to begin to \\ninquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were with her \\nat Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary,  you need not look surprised, Madam \\nMina. It was begun after you had left, an d was an imitation of you, and in that \\ndiary she traces by inferen ce certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts \\ndown that you saved her. In great per plexity then I come to you, and ask you \\nout of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.\"  \\n\"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.\"  \\n\"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always so \\nwith young ladies.\"  \"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show  it to you if you \\nlike.\"  \\n\"Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful.  You will do me much favour.\"  \\nI could not resist the temptation of  mystifying him a bit, I suppose it is \\nsome taste of the original apple that re mains still in our mouths, so I handed \\nhim the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said, \"May I read \\nit?\"  \\n\"If you wish,\" I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for an \\ninstant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.  \\n\"Oh, you so clever woman!\" he said. \"I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a \\nman of much thankfulness, but see, his wi fe have all the good  things. And will \\nyou not so much honour me and so help  me as to read it for me? Alas! I know \\nnot the shorthand.\"  \\nBy this time my little joke was over, a nd I was almost ashamed. So I took \\nthe typewritten copy from my work basket and handed it to him.  \\n\"Forgive me,\" I said. \"I could not help  it, but I had been thinking that it \\nwas of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time \\nto wait, not on my account,  but because I know your time must be precious, I \\nhave written it out on the typewriter for you.\"  \\nHe took it and his eyes glistened. \"Y ou are so good,\" he said. \"And may I \\nread it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.\"  \\n\"By all means,\" I said, \"read it over whilst I order lunch, and then you can \\nask me questions whilst we eat.\"  \\nHe bowed and settled himself in a ch air with his back to the light, and \\nbecame so absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunc h chiefly in \\norder that he might not be disturbed.  When I came back, I found him walking \\nhurriedly up and down the r oom, his face all ablaze with  excitement. He rushed \\nup to me and took me by both hands.  \\n\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, \"how can I say what I owe to you? This paper \\nis as sunshine. It opens the gate to me . I am dazed, I am dazzled, with so much \\nlight, and yet clouds  roll in behind the light ever y time. But that you do not, \\ncannot comprehend. Oh, but I am grat eful to you, you so clever woman. Madame,\" he said this very solemnly, \"if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do \\nanything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It will be pleasure and \\ndelight if I may serve you as a friend, as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all \\nI can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, \\nand there are lights. You are one of the lights. You will have a happy life and a \\ngood life, and your husband will be blessed in you.\"  \\n\"But, doctor, you praise me too mu ch, and you do not know me.\"  \\n\"Not know you, I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and \\nwomen, I who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him \\nand all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you have so \\ngoodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line. I, who have \\nread your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not \\nknow you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and \\nby hour and by minute, such things tha t angels can read. And we men who \\nwish to know have in us something of angels\\' eyes. Your husband is noble \\nnature, and you are noble too, for you trust,  and trust cannot be where there is \\nmean nature. And your husband, tell me of  him. Is he quite well? Is all that \\nfever gone, and is he strong and hearty?\"  \\nI saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so  I said, \"He was almost \\nrecovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins death.\"  \\nHe interrupted, \"Oh, yes. I know. I know. I have read your last two \\nletters.\"  \\nI went on, \"I suppose this upset him , for when we were in town on \\nThursday last he had a sort of shock.\"  \\n\"A shock, and after brain fever so so on! That is not good. What kind of \\nshock was it?\"  \\n\"He thought he saw some one who recal led something terrible, something \\nwhich led to his brain fever.\" And here  the whole thing seemed to overwhelm \\nme in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, th e horror which he experienced, the whole \\nfearful mystery of his diary,  and the fear that has been  brooding over me ever \\nsince, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my \\nknees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband \\nwell again. He took my hand s and raised me up, and ma de me sit on the sofa, \\nand sat by me. He held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite \\nsweetness,  \"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had \\nmuch time for friendships, but since I have been summoned to here by my \\nfriend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility \\nthat I feel more than ever, and it has grown with my advancing years, the \\nloneliness of my life. Believe  me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, \\nand you have given me hope, hope, not in  what I am seeking of, but that there \\nare good women still left to make lif e happy, good women, whose lives and \\nwhose truths may make good lesson for the  children that are to be. I am glad, \\nglad, that I may here be of some use to you. For if your husband suffer, he \\nsuffer within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will \\ngladly do all for him that I can, all to make his life strong and manly, and your \\nlife a happy one. Now you must eat. Yo u are overwrought and perhaps over-\\nanxious. Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale, and what he like \\nnot where he love, is not to his good. Ther efore for his sake you must eat and \\nsmile. You have told me about Lucy, and so  now we shall not sp eak of it, lest it \\ndistress. I shall stay in Exeter tonig ht, for I want to think much over what you \\nhave told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions,  if I may. And \\nthen too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan\\'s trouble so far as you can, but \\nnot yet. You must eat now, afterw ards you shall tell me all.\"  \\nAfter lunch, when we went back to the drawing room, he said to me, \"And \\nnow tell me all about him.\"  \\nWhen it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he \\nwould think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman, that journal is all so \\nstrange, and I hesitated to go on. But he was so sweet a nd kind, and he had \\npromised to help, and I trusted him, so I said,  \\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to te ll you is so queer that you must not \\nlaugh at me or at my husband. I have been  since yesterday in a sort of fever of \\ndoubt. You must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half \\nbelieved some very strange things.\"  \\nHe reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said, \"Oh, \\nmy dear, if you only know how strange is  the matter regarding which I am here, \\nit is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little of any one\\'s belief, \\nno matter how strange it may be. I have tr ied to keep an open mind, and it is \\nnot the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the \\nextraordinary things, the things that make  one doubt if they be mad or sane.\"  \\n\"Thank you, thank you a th ousand times! You have taken a weight off my \\nmind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will te ll you my trouble and Jona than\\'s. It is the copy of \\nhis journal when abroad, and all that ha ppened. I dare not say anything of it. \\nYou will read for yourself and judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you \\nwill be very kind and tell  me what you think.\"  \\n\"I promise,\" he said as I gave him the papers. \"I shall in the morning, as \\nsoon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.\"  \\n\"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch \\nwith us and see him then. You could ca tch the quick 3:34 train, which will \\nleave you at Paddington before eight.\" He was surprised at my knowledge of \\nthe trains offhand, but he  does not know that I have made up all the trains to \\nand from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.  \\nSo he took the papers with him a nd went away, and I si t here thinking, \\nthinking I don\\'t know what.  \\nLETTER (by hand), VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER  \\n25 September, 6 o\\'clock  \\n\"Dear Madam Mina,  \\n\"I have read your husband\\'s so w onderful diary. You may sleep without \\ndoubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is  true! I will pledge my life on it. It may \\nbe worse for others, but for him and you th ere is no dread. He is a noble fellow, \\nand let me tell you from experience of me n, that one who would do as he did in \\ngoing down that wall and to that room, ay e, and going a second time, is not one \\nto be injured in permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right, \\nthis I swear, before I have even seen him, so be at rest. I shall have much to ask \\nhim of other things. I am blessed that to day I come to see you, for I have learn \\nall at once so much that again I am dazzl ed, dazzled more than ever, and I must \\nthink.  \\n\"Yours the most faithful,  \\n\"Abraham Van Helsing.\"  \\n LETTER, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING  \\n25 September, 6:30 P.M.  \"My dear Dr. Van Helsing,  \\n\"A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off \\nmy mind. And yet, if it be true, what te rrible things there are in the world, and \\nwhat an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear to \\nthink. I have this moment, w hilst writing, had a wire fr om Jonathan, saying that \\nhe leaves by the 6:25 tonig ht from Launceston and will be  here at 10:18, so that \\nI shall have no fear tonig ht. Will you, therefore, ins tead of lunching with us, \\nplease come to breakfast at eight o\\'cloc k, if this be not too early for you? You \\ncan get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to \\nPaddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as  I shall take it that, if I do not hear, \\nyou will come to breakfast.  \\n\"Believe me,  \\n\"Your faithful and grateful friend,  \"Mina Harker.\"  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n26 September.--I thought never to write in this diary ag ain, but the time \\nhas come. When I got home last night Mi na had supper ready, and when we \\nhad supped she told me of Van Helsing\\'s visit, and of her having given him the \\ntwo diaries copied out, and of how a nxious she has been about me. She showed \\nme in the doctor\\'s letter that all I wrote down was true. It seems to have made a \\nnew man of me. It was the doubt as to  the reality of the whole thing that \\nknocked me over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that \\nI know, I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in \\nhis design in getting to Lond on, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and \\nhow? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is \\nanything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it over. Mina is dressing, \\nand I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over.   \\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he \\nwas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face \\nround to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny,  \\n\"But Madam Mina told me you were ill,  that you had had a shock.\"  \\nIt was so funny to hear my wife called \\'Madam Mina\\' by this kindly, \\nstrong-faced old man. I smiled, and said, \"I was ill, I have had a shock, but you \\nhave cured me already.\"  \\n\"And how?\"  \\n\"By your letter to Mina last  night. I was in doubt, and then everything took \\na hue of unreality, and I d id not know what to trust, even the evidence of my \\nown senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do, and so had \\nonly to keep on working in what had hith erto been the groove of my life. The \\ngroove ceased to avail me, and I mist rusted myself. Doc tor, you don\\'t know \\nwhat it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don\\'t, you couldn\\'t with \\neyebrows like yours.\"  \\nHe seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, \"So! You are a physiognomist. \\nI learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to \\nbreakfast, and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are \\nblessed in your wife.\"  \\nI would listen to him go on praising M ina for a day, so I simply nodded \\nand stood silent.  \\n\"She is one of God\\'s women, fash ioned by His own hand to show us men \\nand other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light \\ncan be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist, and that, let \\nme tell you, is much in this age, so sc eptical and selfish. And you, sir I have \\nread all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I \\nknow you since some days from the know ing of others, but I have seen your \\ntrue self since last night.  You will give me your hand,  will you not? And let us \\nbe friends for all our lives.\"  \\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite \\nchoky.  \"And now,\" he said, \"may I ask you for some more help? I have a great \\ntask to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here. Can you \\ntell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more \\nhelp, and of a different kind, but at first this will do.\"  \\n\"Look here, Sir,\" I said, \"does what you have to do concern the Count?\"  \\n\"It does,\" he said solemnly.  \\n\"Then I am with you heart and soul. As  you go by the 10:30 train, you will \\nnot have time to read them, but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take \\nthem with you and read them in the train.\"  \\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said, \\n\"Perhaps you will come to town if I send for you, and take Madam Mina too.\"  \\n\"We shall both come when  you will,\" I said.  \\nI had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous \\nnight, and while we were talking at th e carriage window, waiting for the train \\nto start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to catch \\nsomething in one of them, \"The Westm inster Gazette\", I knew it by the colour, \\nand he grew quite white. He read some thing intently, groa ning to himself, \\n\"Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! So soon!\" I do not think he remembered me \\nat the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This \\nrecalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the wi ndow and waved his hand, \\ncalling out, \"Love to Madam Mina. I sh all write so soon as ever I can.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I \\nsaid \"Finis,\" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the \\nrecord. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield \\nhad become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead \\nwith his fly business, and he  had just started in the spider line also, so he had \\nnot been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, \\nand from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is \\nwith him, and that is much of a help, fo r he himself is a bubbling well of good \\nspirits. Quincey wrote me a line too,  and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as to them all my mind \\nis at rest. As for myself, I was settli ng down to my work w ith the enthusiasm \\nwhich I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound \\nwhich poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.  \\nEverything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be the end God only \\nknows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only \\nlet out enough at a time to whet curios ity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and \\nstayed there all night. Today he came back, and almost bounded into the room \\nat about half-past five o\\'clock, and th rust last night\\'s \"Westminster Gazette\" \\ninto my hand.  \\n\"What do you think of that?\" he aske d as he stood back and folded his \\narms.  \\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant, but he \\ntook it from me and pointed out a pa ragraph about children being decoyed \\naway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, \\nand I looked up.  \\n\"Well?\" he said.  \\n\"It is like poor Lucy\\'s.\"  \"And what do you make of it?\"  \\n\"Simply that there is some cause in co mmon. Whatever it was that injured \\nher has injured them.\" I did not quite understand his answer.  \\n\"That is true indirectly, but not directly.\"  \"How do you mean, Professor?\" I asked. I was a little inclined to take his \\nseriousness lightly, for, af ter all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, \\nharrowing, anxiety does help to restore on e\\'s spirits, but when I saw his face, it \\nsobered me. Never, even in the midst of  our despair about poor Lucy, had he \\nlooked more stern.  \\n\"Tell me!\" I said. \"I can hazard no opin ion. I do not know what to think, \\nand I have no data on which to found a conjecture.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to \\nwhat poor Lucy died of, not after all th e hints given, not only by events, but by \\nme?\"  \\n\"Of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste of blood.\"  \\n\"And how was the blood lost or wasted?\" I shook my head.  \\nHe stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on, \"You are a clever \\nman, friend John. You reas on well, and your wit is bold, but you are too \\nprejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is \\noutside your daily life is n ot of account to you.  Do you not thin k that there are \\nthings which you cannot unde rstand, and yet which ar e, that some people see \\nthings that others cannot? But there are th ings old and new which must not be \\ncontemplated by men\\'s eyes, because th ey know, or think they know, some \\nthings which other men have told them. Ah , it is the fault of our science that it \\nwants to explain all, and if it explain not, then it says the re is nothing to explain. \\nBut yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think \\nthemselves new, and which are yet but the  old, which pretend to be young, like \\nthe fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal \\ntransference. No? Nor in materialization.  No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in \\nthe reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism\"  \\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Charcot has proved that pretty well.\"  \\nHe smiled as he went on, \"Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of \\ncourse then you understand how it act, a nd can follow the mind of the great \\nCharcot, alas that he is no more, into the very soul of the patient that he \\ninfluence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, \\nand are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tell me, for I am a student of the brain, how you accept hypnotis m and reject the \\nthought reading. Let me tell you, my frie nd, that there are things done today in \\nelectrical science which would have been  deemed unholy by the very man who \\ndiscovered electricity, who would themselves not so long before been burned \\nas wizards. There are always  mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah \\nlived nine hundred years,  and \\'Old Parr\\' one hundred  and sixty-nine, and yet \\nthat poor Lucy, with four men\\'s blood in her poor ve ins, could not live even \\none day? For, had she live one more day, we could save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know the altogether of comparative \\nanatomy and can say wherefore the qualitie s of brutes are in some men, and not \\nin others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that \\none great spider lived for centuries in th e tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on des cending, he could drink the oil of all the church \\nlamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats \\nthat come out at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their \\nveins, how in some islands of the Wester n seas there are bats which hang on \\nthe trees all day, and those  who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, \\nand that when the sailors sleep on the de ck, because that it is hot, flit down on \\nthem and then, and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even \\nMiss Lucy was?\"  \\n\"Good God, Professor!\" I said, starting up. \"Do you mean to tell me that \\nLucy was bitten by such a bat, and that such a thing is he re in London in the \\nnineteenth century?\"  \\nHe waved his hand for silence, and went on, \"Can you tell me why the \\ntortoise lives more long than generations of men, why the elephant goes on and \\non till he have sees dynastie s, and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat \\nof dog or other complaint? Can you te ll me why men believe in all ages and \\nplaces that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know, because science has vouched for the fact, that there  have been toads shut up in rocks for \\nthousands of years, shut in  one so small hole that only hold him since the youth \\nof the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and \\nhave been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn \\nreaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and \\ntake away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but \\nthat rise up and walk amongst them as before?\"  \\nHere I interrupted him. I was gettin g bewildered. He so crowded on my \\nmind his list of nature\\'s eccentricitie s and possible impos sibilities that my \\nimagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some \\nlesson, as long ago he used to do in hi s study at Amsterdam. But he used them \\nto tell me the thing, so that I could ha ve the object of thought in mind all the \\ntime. But now I was without his help, ye t I wanted to follow him, so I said,  \\n\"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so that I \\nmay apply your knowledge as you go on . At present I am going in my mind \\nfrom point to point as a madman, and not a sa ne one, follows an idea. I feel like \\na novice lumbering through a bog in a midst, jumping from one tussock to \\nanother in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am \\ngoing.\"  \\n\"That is a good image,\" he said. \"Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is this, I \\nwant you to believe.\"  \"To believe what?\"  \\n\"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrat e. I heard once of an \\nAmerican who so defined faith, \\'that fac ulty which enables us to believe things \\nwhich we know to be untrue.\\' For one, I follow that man. He meant that we \\nshall have an open mind, and not let a li ttle bit of truth check the rush of the big \\ntruth, like a small rock does a railway tr uck. We get the small truth first. Good! \\nWe keep him, and we value him, but a ll the same we must not let him think \\nhimself all the truth in the universe.\"  \\n\"Then you want me not to let some  previous conviction inure the \\nreceptivity of my mind with regard to so me strange matter. Do I read your \\nlesson aright?\"  \\n\"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still.  It is worth to teach you. Now that \\nyou are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand. You \\nthink then that those so sma ll holes in the children\\'s throats were made by the \\nsame that made the holes in Miss Lucy?\"  \\n\"I suppose so.\"  \\nHe stood up and said solemnly, \"The n you are wrong. Oh, would it were \\nso! But alas! No. It is wo rse, far, far worse.\"  \\n\"In God\\'s name, Professor Van Helsin g, what do you mean?\" I cried.  \\nHe threw himself with a despairing ge sture into a chair, and placed his \\nelbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke.  \\n\"They were made by Miss Lucy!\"  \\nCHAPTER 15  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--cont.  \\nFor a while sheer anger m\\nastered me. It was as if he had during her life \\nstruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as  I said to him, \"Dr. \\nVan Helsing, are you mad?\"  He raised his head and looked at me , and somehow the tenderness of his \\nface calmed me at once. \"Would I were!\" he said. \"Madness were easy to bear \\ncompared with truth like th is. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far \\nround, why take so long to tell so sim ple a thing? Was it beca use I hate you and \\nhave hated you all my life? Was it be cause I wished to give you pain? Was it \\nthat I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and \\nfrom a fearful death? Ah no!\"  \\n\"Forgive me,\" said I.  \\nHe went on, \"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the \\nbreaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I \\ndo not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the \\'no\\' \\nof it. It is more hard still to accept so sa d a concrete truth, and of such a one as \\nMiss Lucy. Tonight I go to prove it.  Dare you come with me?\"  \\nThis staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth, Byron \\nexcepted from the category, jealousy.  \\n\"And prove the very truth he most abhorred.\" \\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke, \"The  logic is simple, no madman\\'s logic \\nthis time, jumping from tusso ck to tussock in a misty bog.  If it not be true, then \\nproof will be relief. At worst it will no t harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the \\ndread. Yet every dread should help my caus e, for in it is some need of belief. \\nCome, I tell you what I propose. First, that we go off now and see that child in \\nthe hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child \\nis, is a friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at \\nAmsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. \\nWe shall tell him nothing, but only that  we wish to learn. And then\"  \\n\"And then?\"  \\nHe took a key from his pocket and held it up. \"And then we spend the \\nnight, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock \\nthe tomb. I had it from the coffin man to give to Arthur.\"  \\nMy heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal \\nbefore us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and \\nsaid that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing.  We found the child awake. It had ha d a sleep and taken some food, and \\naltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and \\nshowed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which \\nhad been on Lucy\\'s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher, \\nthat was all. We asked Vincent to what he  attributed them, and he replied that it \\nmust have been a bite of some animal , perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he \\nwas inclined to think it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. \"Out of so many harmless ones,\" he said, \"there \\nmay be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape, or even from the \\nZoological Gardens a young on e may have got loose, or one be bred there from \\na vampire. These things do  occur, you, know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, \\nand was, I believe, traced up in this di rection. For a week after, the children \\nwere playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in \\nthe place until this \\'bloofer lady\\' scare cam e along, since then it has been quite \\na gala time with them. Even th is poor little mite, when he woke up today, asked \\nthe nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the \\'bloofer lady\\'.\"  \\n\"I hope,\" said Van Helsing, \"that wh en you are sending the child home you \\nwill caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are \\nmost dangerous, and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I su ppose you will not let it away for some \\ndays?\"  \\n\"Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if the wound is not healed.\"  \\nOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had r eckoned on, and the \\nsun had dipped before we came out. Wh en Van Helsing saw how dark it was, \\nhe said,  \\n\"There is not hurry. It is more late  than I thought. Come, let us seek \\nsomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\"  \\nWe dined at \\'Jack Straw\\'s Castle\\' along with a little crowd of bicyclists and \\nothers who were genially noisy. About ten o\\'clock we started from the inn. It \\nwas then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radi us. The Professor had evidently noted \\nthe road we were to go, for he went on u nhesitatingly, but, as  for me, I was in \\nquite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat su rprised when we met even the patrol of \\nhorse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty, for it was \\nvery dark, and the whole place seemed so  strange to us, we found the Westenra \\ntomb. The Professor took the key, ope ned the creaky door, and standing back, \\npolitely, but quite unconsciously, m otioned me to precede him. There was a \\ndelicious irony in the offer, in the cour tliness of giving preference on such a \\nghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the \\ndoor to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring \\none. In the latter case we should have b een in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in \\nhis bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a \\nlight. The tomb in the daytime, and wh en wreathed with fresh flowers, had \\nlooked grim and gruesome enough, but now, some days afterwards, when the \\nflowers hung lank and dead, their whit es turning to rust an d their greens to \\nbrowns, when the spider and the be etle had resumed their accustomed \\ndominance, when the time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-pla ting gave back the \\nfeeble glimmer of a candle, the effect  was more miserable and sordid than \\ncould have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life, animal life, was not the only thing w hich could pass away.  \\nVan Helsing went about his work sy stematically. Holding his candle so \\nthat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in \\nwhite patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance \\nof Lucy\\'s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.  \\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.  \\n\"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\"  \\nStraightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, \\nshowing the casing of lead beneath. Th e sight was almost too much for me. It \\nseemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have \\nstripped off her clothing in her sleep whil st living. I actually took hold of his \\nhand to stop him.  \\nHe only said, \"You shall see,\" and again fumbling in his bag took out a \\ntiny fret saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward \\nstab, which made me wince, he made  a small hole, which was, however, big \\nenough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the \\nweek-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to \\nbecome accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the \\nProfessor never stopped for a moment. He sawed down a coupl e of feet along \\none side of the lead coffin, and then acr oss, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it b ack towards the foot of the coffin, and \\nholding up the candle int o the aperture, motioned to me to look.  \\nI drew near and looked. The coffin was empty. It was certainly a surprise \\nto me, and gave me a considerable sh ock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He \\nwas now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in \\nhis task. \"Are you satisfied now, friend John?\" he asked.  \\nI felt all the dogged argumentativeness of  my nature awake within me as I \\nanswered him, \"I am satisfied that Lucy \\'s body is not in th at coffin, but that \\nonly proves one thing.\"  \\n\"And what is that, friend John?\"  \\n\"That it is not there.\"  \\n\"That is good logic,\" he said, \"so fa r as it goes. But how  do you, how can \\nyou, account for it not being there?\"  \\n\"Perhaps a body-snatcher,\" I suggested . \"Some of the undertaker\\'s people \\nmay have stolen it.\" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real \\ncause which I could suggest.  \\nThe Professor sighed. \"Ah well!\" he said, \"we must have more proof. \\nCome with me.\"  \\nHe put on the coffin lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them \\nin the bag, blew out the ligh t, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened \\nthe door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying, \"Will you keep it? You had better be assured.\"  \\nI laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say, as I \\nmotioned him to keep it. \"A key is noth ing,\" I said, \"there are many duplicates, \\nand anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of this kind.\"  \\nHe said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at \\none side of the churchyard whilst  he would watch at the other.  \\nI took up my place behind a ye w tree, and I saw his dark figure move until \\nthe intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.  It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock \\nstrike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and \\nangry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for \\ncoming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly ob servant, and not sleepy \\nenough to betray my trust, so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.  \\nSuddenly, as I turned rou nd, I thought I saw somethi ng like a white streak, \\nmoving between two dark yew trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from \\nthe tomb. At the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor\\'s side of the \\nground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved, but I had to go round \\nheadstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little ways off, beyond a \\nline of scattered juniper trees, which ma rked the pathway to the church, a white \\ndim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by \\ntrees, and I could not see where the figure had disappeared. I heard the rustle of \\nactual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it \\nout to me, and said, \"Are you satisfied now?\"  \\n\"No,\" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.  \\n\"Do you not see the child?\"  \"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\"  \\n\"We shall see,\" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way \\nout of the churchyard, he ca rrying the sleeping child.  \\nWhen we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, \\nand struck a match, and looked at the chil d\\'s throat. It was without a scratch or \\nscar of any kind.  \\n\"Was I right?\" I asked triumphantly.  \\n\"We were just in time,\" said the Professor thankfully.  \\nWe had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted \\nabout it. If we were to take it to a police station we should have to give some \\naccount of our movements during the night.  At least, we should have had to \\nmake some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we \\ndecided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman \\ncoming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it. We would then seek our way home as quickly as we could.  All fell out well. At the edge of \\nHampstead Heath we heard a policeman\\'s heavy tramp, and laying the child on \\nthe pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to \\nand fro. We heard his exclamation of  astonishment, and then we went away \\nsilently. By good chance we got a cab near the \\'Spainiards,\\' and drove to town.  \\nI cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours\\' sleep, \\nas Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists th at I go with him on \\nanother expedition.  \\n27 September.--It was two o\\'clock before we found a suitable opportunity \\nfor our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last \\nstragglers of the mourners had take n themselves lazily away, when, looking \\ncarefully from behind a clump of alder tr ees, we saw the sexton lock the gate \\nafter him. We knew that we were safe till morning did we desire it, but the Professor told me that we should not wa nt more than an hour at most. Again I \\nfelt that horrid sense of the reality of th ings, in which any effort of imagination \\nseemed out of place, and I realized dist inctly the perils of the law which we \\nwere incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. \\nOutrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin \\nwas empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van \\nHelsing had a way of goin g on his own road, no matt er who remonstrated. He \\ntook the key, opened the vault, and aga in courteously motioned me to precede. \\nThe place was not so gruesome as last  night, but oh, how  unutterably mean \\nlooking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy\\'s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and ag ain forced back the leaden flange, \\nand a shock of surprise a nd dismay shot through me.  \\nThere lay Lucy, seemingly just as we ha d seen her the night before her \\nfuneral. She was, if possible, more radia ntly beautiful than ever, and I could not \\nbelieve that she was dead. The lips were re d, nay redder than before, and on the \\ncheeks was a delicate bloom.  \\n\"Is this a juggle?\" I said to him.  \\n\"Are you convinced now?\" said the Prof essor, in response, and as he spoke \\nhe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead \\nlips and showed the white te eth. \"See,\" he went on, \"they are even sharper than before. With this and this,\" and he touc hed one of the canine teeth and that \\nbelow it, \"the little children can be bit ten. Are you of belief now, friend John?\"  \\nOnce more argumentative hostili ty woke within me. I could not accept \\nsuch an overwhelming idea as he suggested. So, with an attempt to argue of \\nwhich I was even at the moment ashamed,  I said, \"She may have been placed \\nhere since last night.\"  \\n\"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?\"  \\n\"I do not know. Someone has done it.\"  \\n\"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not \\nlook so.\"  \\nI had no answer for this, so was sile nt. Van Helsing did not seem to notice \\nmy silence. At any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph. He was \\nlooking intently at the face of the dead  woman, raising the eyelids and looking \\nat the eyes, and once more opening th e lips and examining the teeth. Then he \\nturned to me and said,  \\n\"Here, there is one thing which is diffe rent from all recorded. Here is some \\ndual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking, oh, you st art. You do not know that, friend John, \\nbut you shall know it la ter, and in trance could he best come to take more blood. \\nIn trance she dies, and in trance she is UnDead, too. So it is that she differ from \\nall other. Usually when the UnDead sleep at home,\" as he spoke he made a \\ncomprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was \\'home\\', \\n\"their face show what they are, but th is so sweet that was when she not \\nUnDead she go back to th e nothings of the common dead. There is no malign \\nthere, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\"  \\nThis turned my blood cold, and it be gan to dawn upon me that I was \\naccepting Van Helsing\\'s theories. But if she were really dead, what was there of \\nterror in the idea of killing her?  \\nHe looked up at me, and ev idently saw the ch ange in my face,  for he said \\nalmost joyously, \"Ah, you believe now?\"  \\nI answered, \"Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to accept. \\nHow will you do this bloody work?\"  \"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a \\nstake through her body.\"  \\nIt made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom \\nI had loved. And yet the feeling was not so  strong as I had expected. I was, in \\nfact, beginning to shudder at the presence  of this being, this UnDead, as Van \\nHelsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all \\nobjective?  \\nI waited a considerable time for Van He lsing to begin, but he stood as if \\nwrapped in thought. Presen tly he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and \\nsaid,  \\n\"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I \\ndid simply follow my inclini ng I would do now, at this moment, what is to be \\ndone. But there are other th ings to follow, and things  that are thousand times \\nmore difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. She have yet no life \\ntaken, though that is of time, and to act now would be to take danger from her \\nforever. But then we may have to want Arthur, and how sha ll we tell him of \\nthis? If you, who saw the wounds on Lu cy\\'s throat, and saw the wounds so \\nsimilar on the child\\'s at the hospital, if you,  who saw the coffin empty last night \\nand full today with a woman who have n ot change only to be more rose and \\nmore beautiful in a whole week, after sh e die, if you know of this and know of \\nthe white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of \\nyour own senses you did not believe, ho w then, can I expect Arthur, who know \\nnone of those things, to believe?  \\n\"He doubted me when I took him from  her kiss when she was dying. I \\nknow he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things \\nthat prevent him say goodbye as he ought,  and he may think that in some more \\nmistaken idea this woman was buried alive, and that in most mistake of all we \\nhave killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have \\nkilled her by our ideas, and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never \\ncan be sure, and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that wi ll paint his dreams with horrors of what \\nshe must have suffered, and again, he w ill think that we may be right, and that \\nhis so beloved was, after all, an UnD ead. No! I told him once, and since then I \\nlearn much. Now, since I know it is al l true, a hundred thousand times more do \\nI know that he must pass through the bi tter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor \\nfellow, must have one hour that will make  the very face of heaven grow black \\nto him, then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is \\nmade up. Let us go. You return home fo r tonight to your as ylum, and see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my \\nown way. Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of \\nthe clock. I shall send for Arthur to come  too, and also that so fine young man \\nof America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with \\nyou so far as Piccadilly and there dine, fo r I must be back here before the sun \\nset.\"  \\nSo we locked the tomb and came aw ay, and got over the wall of the \\nchurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.  \\nNOTE LEFT BY VAN HELSIN G IN HIS PORTMANTEAU, \\nBERKELEY HOTEL DIRECTED TO JOHN SEWARD, M. D. (Not \\nDelivered)  \\n27 September  \\n\"Friend John,  \\n\"I write this in case anything should  happen. I go alone to watch in that \\nchurchyard. It pleases me that the UnD ead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave tonight, \\nthat so on the morrow night she may be more eager. Therefor e I shall fix some \\nthings she like not, garlic an d a crucifix, and so seal up the door of the tomb. \\nShe is young as UnDead, and will heed . Moreover, these are only to prevent \\nher coming out. They may not prevail on her wanting to get in, for then the \\nUnDead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it \\nmay be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after sunrise, and if there \\nbe aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have \\nno fear, but that other to whom is there that she is UnDead, he have not the \\npower to seek her tomb and find shelter.  He is cunning, as  I know from Mr. \\nJonathan and from the way that all al ong he have fooled us when he played \\nwith us for Miss Lucy\\'s life, and we lost, and in many ways the UnDead are \\nstrong. He have always the strength in hi s hand of twenty men, even we four \\nwho gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can \\nsummon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he came thither on this \\nnight he shall find me. But none other shall, until it be too late. But it may be \\nthat he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should. His hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the UnDead \\nwoman sleeps, and the one old man watch.  \"Therefore I write this in case Take the papers that are with this, the \\ndiaries of Harker and the rest, and read  them, and then find this great UnDead, \\nand cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the \\nworld may rest from him.  \\n\"If it be so, farewell.  \\n\"VAN HELSING.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n28 September.--It is wonderful what a good night\\'s sleep will do for one. \\nYesterday I was almost willing to accep t Van Helsing\\'s monstrous ideas, but \\nnow they seem to start out lurid befo re me as outrages on common sense. I \\nhave no doubt that he believes it all. I wo nder if his mind can have become in \\nany way unhinged. Surely there must be some rational explanation of all these \\nmysterious things. Is it possible that th e Professor can have done it himself? He \\nis so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his \\nintent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loathe to think it, \\nand indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van \\nHelsing was mad, but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some light on the mystery.  \\n29 September.--Last night, at a little  before ten o\\'clock, Arthur and \\nQuincey came into Van Helsing\\'s room. He told us all what he wanted us to do, \\nbut especially addressing himself to Arthur , as if all our wills were centred in \\nhis. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with  him too, \"for,\" \\nhe said, \"there is a grave duty to be done there. You we re doubtless surprised at \\nmy letter?\" This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.  \\n\"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble around \\nmy house of late that I coul d do without any more. I have  been curious, too, as \\nto what you mean.  \\n\"Quincey and I talked it over, but the more we talked, the more puzzled we \\ngot, till now I can say for myself that I\\'m about up a tree as to any meaning \\nabout anything.\"  \"Me too,\" said Quincey Morris laconically.  \\n\"Oh,\" said the Professor, \"then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, \\nthan friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so \\nfar as to begin.\"  \\nIt was evident that he recognized my return to my old doubting frame of \\nmind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other tw o, he said with \\nintense gravity,  \\n\"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I know, \\nmuch to ask, and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and \\nonly then how much. Therefore may I as k that you promise me in the dark, so \\nthat afterwards, though you may be an gry with me for a time, I must not \\ndisguise from myself the possibility that such ma y be, you shall not blame \\nyourselves for anything.\"  \\n\"That\\'s frank anyhow,\" br oke in Quincey. \"I\\'ll answer for the Professor. I \\ndon\\'t quite see his drift, but I swear he\\'s honest, and th at\\'s good enough for me.\"  \\n\"I thank you, Sir,\" said Van Helsing proudly. \"I have done myself the \\nhonour of counting you one trusting fr iend, and such endorsement is dear to \\nme.\" He held out a hand, which Quincey took.  \\nThen Arthur spoke out, \"Dr. Van Helsin g, I don\\'t quite like  to \\'buy a pig in \\na poke\\', as they say in Scot land, and if it be anything in which my honour as a \\ngentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a \\npromise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of \\nthese two, then I give my consent at once, though for the life of me, I cannot \\nunderstand what you are driving at.\"  \\n\"I accept your limitation,\" said Van Hels ing, \"and all I ask of you is that if \\nyou feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well \\nand be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations.\"  \\n\"Agreed!\" said Arthur. \"That is only fair. And now that the pourparlers are \\nover, may I ask what it is we are to do?\"  \\n\"I want you to come with me, and to co me in secret, to the churchyard at \\nKingstead.\"  \\nArthur\\'s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way,  \"Where poor Lucy is buried?\"  \\nThe Professor bowed.  Arthur went on, \"And when there?\"  \"To enter the tomb!\"  \\nArthur stood up. \"Professor, are you in earnest, or is it some monstrous \\njoke? Pardon me, I see that you are in earne st.\" He sat down again, but I could \\nsee that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was \\nsilence until he asked again,  \"And when in the tomb?\"  \\n\"To open the coffin.\"  \\n\"This is too much!\" he said, angril y rising again. \"I am willing to be \\npatient in all things that are reasonable, bu t in this, this desecration of the grave, \\nof one who\" He fairly ch oked with indignation.  \\nThe Professor looked pityingly at him. \"If I could spare you one pang, my \\npoor friend,\" he said, \"God knows I would. But this night our feet must tread in \\nthorny paths, or later, and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of \\nflame!\"  \\nArthur looked up with set white face and said, \"Take care, sir, take care!\"  \\n\"Would it not be well to hear what I ha ve to say?\" said Van Helsing. \"And \\nthen you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go on?\"  \\n\"That\\'s fair enough,\" broke in Morris.  After a pause Van Helsing went on, evid ently with an effort , \"Miss Lucy is \\ndead, is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to her. But if she be not \\ndead\"  \\nArthur jumped to his feet, \"Good God! \" he cried. \"What do you mean? \\nHas there been any mistake, has she been  buried alive?\" He groaned in anguish \\nthat not even hope could soften.  \\n\"I did not say she was alive, my chi ld. I did not think it. I go no further \\nthan to say that she might be UnDead.\"  \"UnDead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what is \\nit?\"  \\n\"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they \\nmay solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But I have \\nnot done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\"  \\n\"Heavens and earth, no!\" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. \"Not for the \\nwide world will I consent to any mutilation  of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, \\nyou try me too far. What have I done to you that you should  torture me so? \\nWhat did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour \\non her grave? Are you mad, that you speak of  such things, or am I mad to listen \\nto them? Don\\'t dare think more of such a desecration. I shall not give my \\nconsent to anything you do. I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from \\noutrage, and by God, I shall do it!\"  \\nVan Helsing rose up from where he ha d all the time been seated, and said, \\ngravely and sternly, \"My Lord Godalming, I too, have a duty to do, a duty to \\nothers, a duty to you, a duty to the dead, and by God, I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with  me, that you look and listen, and if when later I \\nmake the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfillment even than I am, then, I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow \\nyour Lordship\\'s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.\" His voi ce broke a little, an d he went on with \\na voice full of pity.  \\n\"But I beseech you, do not go forth in  anger with me. In a long life of acts \\nwhich were often not pleasant to do, a nd which sometimes did wring my heart, \\nI have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all \\nthis so sad hour, for I would do what a ma n can to save you from sorrow. Just \\nthink. For why should I give myself so much labor and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good, at the first to \\nplease my friend John, and then to help  a sweet young lady, whom too, I come \\nto love. For her, I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in  kindness, I gave \\nwhat you gave, the blood of my veins. I gave it, I who was not, like you, her \\nlover, but only her physicia n and her friend. I gave her my nights and days, \\nbefore death, after death, and if my death can do her good even now, when she \\nis the dead UnDead, she shall have it fr eely.\" He said this with a very grave, \\nsweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it.  He took the old man\\'s hand and said in a broken voice, \"Oh,  it is hard to \\nthink of it, and I cannot unde rstand, but at least I shall go with you and wait.\"  \\nCHAPTER 16  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--cont.  \\nIt was just a quar\\nter before twelve o\\' clock when we got into the churchyard \\nover the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight \\nbetween the dents of the he avy clouds that scudded ac ross the sky. We all kept \\nsomehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. \\nWhen we had come close to the tomb I lo oked well at Arthur, for I feared the \\nproximity to a place laden with so so rrowful a memory would upset him, but he \\nbore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for var ious reasons, solved the difficulty by \\nentering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to a coffin.  Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly. \\nVan Helsing said to me, \"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of \\nMiss Lucy in that coffin?\"  \\n\"It was.\"  \\nThe Professor turned to the rest sayi ng, \"You hear, and yet there is no one \\nwho does not believe with me.\"  \\nHe took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur \\nlooked on, very pale but silent. When th e lid was removed he stepped forward. \\nHe evidently did not kn ow that there was a leaden co ffin, or at any rate, had not \\nthought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood ru shed to his face for \\nan instant, but as quickly fe ll away again, so that he remained of a ghastly \\nwhiteness. He was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and \\nwe all looked in and recoiled.  \\nThe coffin was empty!  \\nFor several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by \\nQuincey Morris, \"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I \\nwouldn\\'t ask such a thing ordinarily, I wouldn\\'t so dishonour you as to imply a doubt, but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this \\nyour doing?\"  \\n\"I swear to you by all that I hold sacr ed that I have not removed or touched \\nher. What happened was this. Two nig hts ago my friend Seward and I came \\nhere, with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then \\nsealed up, and we found it as now, em pty. We then waited, and saw something \\nwhite come through the trees. The next  day we came here in daytime and she \\nlay there. Did she not, friend John?  \\n\"Yes.\"  \\n\"That night we were just in time. One more so sm all child was missing, \\nand we find it, thank God, unharmed am ongst the graves. Yesterday I came \\nhere before sundown, for at sundown the UnDead can move. I waited here all \\nnight till the sun rose, but I saw nothing.  It was most probable that it was \\nbecause I had laid over the clamps of  those doors garlic, which the UnDead \\ncannot bear, and other thing s which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, \\nso tonight before the sun down I took away my garlic and other things. And so \\nit is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is \\nstrange. Wait you with me o utside, unseen and unheard, and things much \\nstranger are yet to be. So,\" here he shut the dark slide of his lantern, \"now to the outside.\" He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking \\nthe door behind him.  \\nOh! But it seemed fresh and pure in the  night air after the terror of that \\nvault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the \\nmoonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing, like the gladness \\nand sorrow of a man\\'s life. How sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had \\nno taint of death a nd decay. How humanizing to see th e red lighting of the sky \\nbeyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a \\ngreat city. Each in his own way was so lemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, \\nand was, I could see, stri ving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the \\nmystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside \\ndoubt and to accept Van Helsing\\'s c onclusions. Quincey Morris was \\nphlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the \\nspirit of cool bravery, with hazard of al l he has at stake. Not being able to \\nsmoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to \\nVan Helsing, he was employed in a definite  way. First he took from his bag a \\nmass of what looked like thin, wafer- like biscuit, which wa s carefully rolled up \\nin a white napkin. Next he took out a doub le handful of some whitish stuff, like \\ndough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it in to thin strips, began to lay \\nthem into the crevices between the door  and its setting in the tomb. I was \\nsomewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was \\ndoing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious.  \\nHe answered, \"I am closing the tomb so that the UnDead may not enter.\"  \\n\"And is that stuff you have there going to do it?\"  \\n\"It is.\"  \\n\"What is that which you are using?\" This time the question was by Arthur. \\nVan Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered.  \\n\"The Host. I brought it from Amst erdam. I have an Indulgence.\"  \\nIt was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt \\nindividually that in the presence of such  earnest purpose as the Professor\\'s, a \\npurpose which could thus use the to hi m most sacred of things, it was \\nimpossible to distrust. In respectful sile nce we took the place s assigned to us \\nclose round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I \\npitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my \\nformer visits to this watc hing horror, and yet I, w ho had up to an hour ago \\nrepudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink  within me. Never did tombs look so \\nghastly white. Never did cypress, or yew,  or juniper so seem the embodiment \\nof funeral gloom. Never did tree or gras s wave or rustle so ominously. Never \\ndid bough creak so mysteriously, and never did the far-away howling of dogs \\nsend such a woeful presage through the night.  \\nThere was a long spell of silence, big,  aching, void, and then from the \\nProfessor a keen \"S-s-s-s!\" He pointed , and far down the avenue of yews we \\nsaw a white figure advance, a dim white figure, which held something dark at \\nits breast. The figure stopped, and at  the moment a ray of  moonlight fell upon \\nthe masses of driving clouds, and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired \\nwoman, dressed in the cerements of the gr ave. We could not see the face, for it \\nwas bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause \\nand a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the \\nfire and dreams. We were starting forw ard, but the Professor\\'s warning hand, \\nseen by us as he stood behi nd a yew tree, kept us back. And then as we looked \\nthe white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My  own heart grew cold as ice, and I \\ncould hear the gasp of Arthur, as we r ecognized the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, \\nheartless cruelty, and the purit y to voluptuous wantonness.  \\nVan Helsing stepped out, and obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too. \\nThe four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised \\nhis lantern and drew the slide. By the conc entrated light that fell on Lucy\\'s face \\nwe could see that the lips were crimson w ith fresh blood, and that the stream \\nhad trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.  \\nWe shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even \\nVan Helsing\\'s iron nerve had failed. Arth ur was next to me, and if I had not \\nseized his arm and held him up,  he would have fallen.  \\nWhen Lucy, I call the thing that was be fore us Lucy because it bore her \\nshape, saw us she drew back with an an gry snarl, such as a cat gives when \\ntaken unawares, then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy\\'s eyes in form and colour, but Lucy\\'s eyes unclean and full of hell fi re, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we \\nknew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing. \\nHad she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she \\nlooked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face b ecame wreathed with a \\nvoluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless \\nmotion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she \\nhad clutched strenuously to her breast, gr owling over it as a dog growls over a \\nbone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-\\nbloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur. When she advanced \\nto him with outstretched arms and a wanton  smile he fell back and hid his face \\nin his hands.  \\nShe still advanced, however, and with a languorous, volupt uous grace, said, \\n\"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry \\nfor you. Come, and we can rest toge ther. Come, my husband, come!\"  \\nThere was something diabolically sw eet in her tones, something of the \\ntinkling of glass when struck, which ra ng through the brains even of us who \\nheard the words addressed to another.  \\nAs for Arthur, he seemed under a spell,  moving his hands from his face, he \\nopened wide his arms. She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang \\nforward and held between them his little golden crucifix.  She recoiled from it, \\nand, with a suddenly distorted  face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter \\nthe tomb.  When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested \\nby some irresistible force. Then she tu rned, and her face was shown in the clear \\nburst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van \\nHelsing\\'s nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face, and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen agai n by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour \\nbecame livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell fi re, the brows were \\nwrinkled as though the folds of flesh were the coils of Medusa\\'s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an ope n square, as in the passion masks of \\nthe Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death, if looks could kill, we saw \\nit at that moment.  \\nAnd so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained \\nbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred  closing of her means of entry.  \\nVan Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, \"Answer me, oh my \\nfriend! Am I to proceed in my work?\"  \\n\"Do as you will, friend. Do as you will . There can be no horror like this \\never any more.\" And he groaned in spirit.  \\nQuincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We \\ncould hear the click of the  closing lantern as Van Helsing held it  down. Coming \\nclose to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on with horrified amazement \\nas we saw, when he stood back, the wo man, with a corporeal body as real at \\nthat moment as our own, pass through th e interstice where scarce a knife blade \\ncould have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor \\ncalmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.  \\nWhen this was done, he lifted the c hild and said, \"Come now, my friends. \\nWe can do no more till tomorrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall \\nall come before long after that. The friend s of the dead will all be gone by two, \\nand when the sexton locks the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do, \\nbut not like this of tonight. As for this little one, he is not much harmed, and by \\ntomorrow night he shall be well. We sh all leave him where the police will find \\nhim, as on the other night, and then to home.\"  \\nComing close to Arthur, he said, \"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore \\ntrial, but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter waters, my child. By this time tomorrow you will, please God, \\nhave passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters. So do not mourn over-much. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\"  Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other \\non the way. We had left behind the child in safety, and were tired. So we all \\nslept with more or less reality of sleep.  \\n29 September, night.--A little before  twelve o\\'clock we three, Arthur, \\nQuincey Morris, and myself, called for the Professor. It was odd to notice that \\nby common consent we had all put on black  clothes. Of course, Arthur wore \\nblack, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We \\ngot to the graveyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official \\nobservation, so that when the gravedig gers had completed their task and the \\nsexton, under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his l ittle black bag, had with \\nhim a long leather one, so mething like a cricketing ba g. It was manifestly of \\nfair weight.  \\nWhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the \\nroad, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered,  closing it behind us. Then he took \\nfrom his bag the lantern, which he lit,  and also two wax can dles, which, when \\nlighted, he stuck by melting their own e nds, on other coffins, so that they might \\ngive light sufficient to  work by. When he again lift ed the lid off Lucy\\'s coffin \\nwe all looked, Arthur trembling like an aspen, and saw that th e corpse lay there \\nin all its death beauty. But there was no  love in my own he art, nothing but \\nloathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy\\'s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur\\'s face grow hard as  he looked. Presentl y he said to Van \\nHelsing, \"Is this really Lucy\\'s bod y, or only a demon in her shape?\"  \\n\"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you shall see her as she \\nwas, and is.\"  \\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there, the pointed teeth, \\nthe blood stained, volupt uous mouth, which made one  shudder to see, the \\nwhole carnal and unspirited appearance,  seeming like a devilish mockery of \\nLucy\\'s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with  his usual methodicalness, began taking \\nthe various contents from his bag and pl acing them ready for use. First he took \\nout a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the  tomb, gas which burned at a fierce heat \\nwith a blue flame, then his operating knive s, which he placed to hand, and last \\na round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about \\nthree feet long. One end of it was harden ed by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a h eavy hammer, such as in \\nhouseholds is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor\\'s \\npreparations for work of any kind are st imulating and bracing, but the effect of \\nthese things on both Arthur and Quin cey was to cause them a sort of \\nconsternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and \\nquiet.  \\nWhen all was ready, Van Helsing said, \"Before we do anything, let me tell \\nyou this. It is out of the lore and experi ence of the ancients and of all those who \\nhave studied the powers of the UnDead. When they become such, there comes \\nwith the change the curse of immortality.  They cannot die, but must go on age \\nafter age adding new victims and multiplyi ng the evils of the world. For all that \\ndie from the preying of the Undead become themselves Undead, and prey on \\ntheir kind. And so the circle goes on ever  widening, like as the ripples from a \\nstone thrown in the water. Friend Arth ur, if you had met that kiss which you \\nknow of before poor Lucy die, or again, last night when you open your arms to \\nher, you would in time, wh en you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call \\nit in Eastern Europe, and would for a ll time make more of those Un-Deads that \\nso have filled us with horror. The career of  this so unhappy dear  lady is but just \\nbegun. Those children whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much the worse, but if she lives on, UnDead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her, and so she draw their blood with that so \\nwicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease. The tiny wounds of the \\nthroats disappear, and they go back to th eir play unknowing ever of what has \\nbeen. But of the most blessed of all, wh en this now UnDead be made to rest as \\ntrue dead, then the soul of the poor la dy whom we love shall again be free. \\nInstead of working wicked ness by night and growing more debased in the \\nassimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, \\nmy friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets \\nher free. To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better \\nright? Will it be no joy to think of he reafter in the silence of the night when \\nsleep is not, \\'It was my hand that sent her to the stars. It was the hand of him that loved her best, the hand that of al l she would herself have chosen, had it \\nbeen to her to choose?\\' Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?\"  \\nWe all looked at Arthur. He saw too, what we all did, the infinite kindness \\nwhich suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as \\na holy, and not an unholy, memory. He  stepped forward and said bravely, \\nthough his hand trembled, and his face wa s as pale as snow, \"My true friend, \\nfrom the bottom of my broken heart I thank  you. Tell me what  I am to do, and I \\nshall not falter!\"  Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, \"Brave lad! A moment\\'s \\ncourage, and it is done. This stake must  be driven through her. It well be a \\nfearful ordeal, be not deceived in that, but it will be only a short time, and you \\nwill then rejoice more than your pain was great. From this grim tomb you will \\nemerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have \\nbegun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray \\nfor you all the time.\"  \\n\"Go on,\" said Arthur hoarsely. \"T ell me what I am to do.\"  \\n\"Take this stake in your left  hand, ready to place to the point over the heart, \\nand the hammer in your right. Then when  we begin our prayer for the dead, I \\nshall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow, strike in God\\'s \\nname, that so all may be well with the d ead that we love and that the UnDead \\npass away.\"  \\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on \\naction his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened his \\nmissal and began to read, and Quincey an d I followed as well as we could.  \\nArthur placed the point over the heart, an d as I looked I could see its dint \\nin the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.  \\nThe thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-curdling screech \\ncame from the opened red lips. The bo dy shook and quivered and twisted in \\nwild contortions. The sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, \\nand the mouth was smeared with a crims on foam. But Arthur never faltered. He \\nlooked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving \\ndeeper and deeper the mercy-bearing st ake, whilst the blood from the pierced \\nheart welled and spurte d up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed \\nto shine through it. The sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to \\nring through the little vault.  \\nAnd then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth \\nseemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still.  The terrible task \\nwas over.  \\nThe hammer fell from Arthur\\'s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had \\nwe not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his \\nbreath came in broken gasps. It had inde ed been an awful strain on him, and \\nhad he not been forced to his task by more than human cons iderations he could \\nnever have gone through with it. For a fe w minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin. When we did, however, a murmur \\nof startled surprise ran from one to the other of us . We gazed so eagerly that \\nArthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too, \\nand then a glad strange lig ht broke over his face and dispelled altogether the \\ngloom of horror that lay upon it.  \\nThere, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded \\nand grown to hate that the work of her de struction was yielded as a privilege to \\nthe one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life, with her face of \\nunequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste. But these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy \\ncalm that lay like sunshine over the wa sted face and form was only an earthly \\ntoken and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.  \\nVan Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur\\'s shoulder, and said to him, \\n\"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\"  \\nThe reaction of the terrible strain cam e as he took the old man\\'s hand in his, \\nand raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said, \"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul agai n, and me peace.\" He put his hands on the \\nProfessor\\'s shoulder, and laying his head on  his breast, cried for a while silently, \\nwhilst we stood unmoving.  \\nWhen he raised his head Van Helsing said to him, \"And now, my child, \\nyou may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she w ould have you to, if \\nfor her to choose. For she is not a grinning devil now, not any more a foul \\nThing for all eternity. No longer she is the devil\\'s UnDead. She is God\\'s true \\ndead, whose soul is with Him!\"  \\nArthur bent and kissed he r, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the \\ntomb. The Professor and I sawed the top of f the stake, leaving the point of it in \\nthe body. Then we cut off the head  and filled the mouth with garlic. We \\nsoldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin lid, and gathering up our \\nbelongings, came away. When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to \\nArthur.  \\nOutside the air was sweet, the sun shone , and the birds sang, and it seemed \\nas if all nature were tuned to a diffe rent pitch. There was gladness and mirth \\nand peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselve s on one account, and we \\nwere glad, though it was with a tempered joy.  Before we moved away Van Helsing sa id, \"Now, my friends, one step of \\nour work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a \\ngreater task: to find out the author of a ll this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I \\nhave clues which we can follow, but it is a long task, and a difficult one, and \\nthere is danger in it, and pain. Shall yo u not all help me? We have learned to \\nbelieve, all of us, is it not so? And si nce so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And \\ndo we not promise to go on to the bitter end?\"  \\nEach in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the \\nProfessor as we moved off, \"Two night s hence you shall meet with me and dine \\ntogether at seven of the clock with frie nd John. I shall entreat two others, two \\nthat you know not as yet, and I shall be ready to all our work show and our \\nplans unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult you about, and you can help me. T onight I leave for Amsterdam, but shall \\nreturn tomorrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know wh at to do and to dread. Then our promise \\nshall be made to each other anew. For there is a terrible task before us, and \\nonce our feet are on the ploughshare  we must not draw back.\"  \\nCHAPTER 17  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--cont.  \\nWhen we arrive \\nd at the Berkely H otel, Van Helsing found a telegram \\nwaiting for him.  \\n\"Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news. Mina \\nHarker.\"  \\nThe Professor was delighted. \"Ah, tha t wonderful Madam Mina,\" he said, \\n\"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cann ot stay. She must go to your house, \\nfriend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her en route so that \\nshe may be prepared.\"  \\nWhen the wire was dispatch ed he had a cup of tea. Over it he told me of a \\ndiary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of \\nit, as also of Mrs. Harker\\'s diary at Whitby. \"Take these,\" he said, \"and study them well. When I have returned you will be  master of all the facts, and we can \\nthen better enter on our inquisition. K eep them safe, for there is in them much \\nof treasure. You will need all your fa ith, even you who have had such an \\nexperience as that of today. What is here told,\" he laid his hand heavily and \\ngravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, \"may be the beginning of the end \\nto you and me and many another, or it may sound the knell of the UnDead who \\nwalk the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind, and if you can add in \\nany way to the story here told do so, for it is all important. You have kept a \\ndiary of all these so strange things, is it not so? Yes! Then we shall go through all these together when we meet.\" He then made ready for his departure and \\nshortly drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way to Paddington, where I \\narrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.  \\nThe crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival \\nplatforms, and I was beginning to feel un easy, lest I might miss my guest, when \\na sweet-faced, dainty looking girl steppe d up to me, and afte r a quick glance \\nsaid, \"Dr. Seward, is it not?\"  \\n\"And you are Mrs. Harker!\" I answered  at once, whereupon she held out \\nher hand.  \\n\"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy, but\" She stopped \\nsuddenly, and a quick blus h overspread her face.  \\nThe blush that rose to my  own cheeks somehow set us  both at ease, for it \\nwas a tacit answer to her own. I got he r luggage, which included a typewriter, \\nand we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my \\nhousekeeper to have a sitting room and a bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. \\nHarker.  \\nIn due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic \\nasylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we \\nentered.  \\nShe told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as \\nshe had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary \\nwhilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers \\nwhich Van Helsing left with me, though the y lie open before me. I must get her \\ninterested in something, so that I may ha ve an opportunity of  reading them. She \\ndoes not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be \\ncareful not to frighten her. Here she is!   \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n29 September.--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward\\'s \\nstudy. At the door I paused a moment,  for I thought I heard him talking with \\nsome one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, \\nand on his calling out, \"Come in,\" I entered.  \\nTo my intense surprise, there wa s no one with him. He was quite alone, \\nand on the table opposite him was what I kn ew at once from the description to \\nbe a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.  \\n\"I hope I did not keep you waiting,\" I said, \"but I stayed at the door as I \\nheard you talking, and thought th ere was someone with you.\"  \\n\"Oh,\" he replied with a smile, \"I was only entering my diary.\"  \\n\"Your diary?\" I asked him in surprise.  \"Yes,\" he answered. \"I keep it in this.\" As he spoke he laid his hand on the \\nphonograph. I felt quite exci ted over it, and blurted out,  \"Why, this beats even \\nshorthand! May I hear it say something?\"  \\n\"Certainly,\" he replied with alacrity , and stood up to put it in train for \\nspeaking. Then he paused, and a tr oubled look overspread his face.  \\n\"The fact is,\" he began awkwardly, \"I only keep my diary in it, and as it is \\nentirely, almost entirely, about my cases it may be awkward, that is, I mean\" \\nHe stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment.  \\n\"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the  end. Let me hear how she died, for \\nall that I know of her, I shall be very gr ateful. She was very, very dear to me.\"  \\nTo my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face, \"Tell \\nyou of her death? Not for the wide world!\"  \\n\"Why not?\" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.  \\nAgain he paused, and I could see that he was trying to inven t an excuse. At \\nlength, he stammered out, \"You see,  I do not know how to pick out any \\nparticular part of the diary.\"  Even while he was speaking an idea da wned upon him, and he said with \\nunconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naivete of a child, \\n\"that\\'s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!\"  \\nI could not but smile, at which he grimaced. \"I gave myself away that \\ntime!\" he said. \"But do y ou know that, although I have kept the diary for \\nmonths past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular \\npart of it in case I wanted to look it up?\"  \\nBy this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended \\nLucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible \\nBeing, and I said boldly, \"Then, Dr. Se ward, you had better let me copy it out \\nfor you on my typewriter.\"  \\nHe grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said , \"No! No! No! For all the \\nworld. I wouldn\\'t let you know that terrible story!\"  \\nThen it was terrible. My intuition wa s right! For a moment, I thought, and \\nas my eyes ranged the room, unconsc iously looking for something or some \\nopportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of type writing on the table. His \\neyes caught the look in mine, and witho ut his thinking, followed their direction. \\nAs they saw the parcel he realized my meaning.  \\n\"You do not know me,\" I said. \"When you have read those papers, my own \\ndiary and my husband\\'s also, which I ha ve typed, you will know me better. I \\nhave not faltered in giving every thought of  my own heart in this cause. But, of \\ncourse, you do not know me, ye t, and I must not expect you to trust me so far.\"  \\nHe is certainly a man of noble nature. Poor dear Lucy was right about him. \\nHe stood up and opened a large drawer , in which were arranged in order a \\nnumber of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said,  \\n\"You are quite right. I did not trust y ou because I did not know you. But I \\nknow you now, and let me sa y that I should have kn own you long ago. I know \\nthat Lucy told you of me. She told me  of you too. May I make the only \\natonement in my power? Take the cylinder s and hear them. The first half-dozen \\nof them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you. Then you will know \\nme better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the meantime I shall read over some \\nof these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things.\"  He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjusted it \\nfor me. Now I shall learn something pleasa nt, I am sure. For it will tell me the \\nother side of a true love episode of  which I know one side already.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n29 September.--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan \\nHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking. \\nMrs. Harker was not down when the maid  came to announce dinner, so I said, \\n\"She is possibly tired. Let dinner wait an hour,\" and I went on with my work. I \\nhad just finished Mrs. Harker\\'s diary, when she came in. She looked sweetly \\npretty, but very sad, and her eyes we re flushed with crying. This somehow \\nmoved me much. Of late I have had caus e for tears, God k nows! But the relief \\nof them was denied me, and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened by recent tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could, \"I greatly \\nfear I have distressed you.\"  \\n\"Oh, no, not distressed me,\" she replied. \"But I have been more touched \\nthan I can say by your grief. That is a wo nderful machine, but it is cruelly true. \\nIt told me, in its very tones, the anguish of  your heart. It was like a soul crying \\nout to Almighty God. No one must hear  them spoken ever again! See, I have \\ntried to be useful. I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other \\nneed now hear your h eart beat, as I did.\"  \\n\"No one need ever know, sh all ever know,\" I said in  a low voice. She laid \\nher hand on mine and said very gravely, \"Ah, but they must!\"  \\n\"Must! But why?\" I asked.  \\n\"Because it is a part of the terrible stor y, a part of poor Lucy\\'s death and all \\nthat led to it. Because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth \\nof this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which \\nwe can get. I think that the cylinders w hich you gave me contained more than \\nyou intended me to know. But I can se e that there are in your record many \\nlights to this dark mystery. You will let me help, will yo u not? I know all up to \\na certain point, and I see already, th ough your diary only took me to 7 \\nSeptember, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being \\nwrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor \\nVan Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whit by to get more information, and he will be here tomorrow to help us. We need  have no secrets amongst us. Working \\ntogether and with absolute trust, we can su rely be stronger than if some of us \\nwere in the dark.\"  \\nShe looked at me so appealingly, a nd at the same time manifested such \\ncourage and resolution in her bearing, tha t I gave in at once to her wishes. \"You \\nshall,\" I said, \"do as you like in the  matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! \\nThere are terrible things yet to learn of, bu t if you have so far traveled on the \\nroad to poor Lucy\\'s death, you will no t be content, I know, to remain in the \\ndark. Nay, the end, the very end, may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there \\nis dinner. We must keep one another str ong for what is before us. We have a \\ncruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I \\nshall answer any questions you ask, if there be anything which you do not \\nunderstand, though it was apparent to us who were present.\"  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n29 September.--After dinner I came with  Dr. Seward to his study. He \\nbrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took a chair, and arranged \\nthe phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how \\nto stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, \\nwith his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I \\nput the forked metal to my ears and listened.  \\nWhen the terrible story of Lucy\\'s dea th, and all that followed, was done, I \\nlay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. \\nWhen Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and \\nhurriedly taking a case bottle from the cu pboard, gave me some brandy, which \\nin a few minutes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that \\nmy dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without \\nmaking a scene. It is all so wild and my sterious, and strange that if I had not \\nknown Jonathan\\'s experience in Transylva nia I could not have believed. As it \\nwas, I didn\\'t know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending \\nto something else. I took the cover off my  typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward,  \\n\"Let me write this all out now. We  must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing \\nwhen he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he \\narrives in London from Whitb y. In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all of our material ready, and have every item put in \\nchronological order, we shall have done much.  \\n\"You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us \\nbe able to tell them when they come.\"  \\nHe accordingly set the phon ograph at a slow pace, an d I began to typewrite \\nfrom the beginning of the seventeenth cylinder. I used manifold, and so took \\nthree copies of the diary, just  as I had done with the re st. It was late when I got \\nthrough, but Dr. Seward went about his wo rk of going his round of the patients. \\nWhen he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not \\nfeel too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is. The world \\nseems full of good men, even if there are monsters in it.  \\nBefore I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the \\nProfessor\\'s perturbation at reading some thing in an evening paper at the station \\nat Exeter, so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files \\nof \\'The Westminster Gazette\\' and \\'The  Pall Mall Gazette\\' and took them to my \\nroom. I remember how much the \\'Dailygraph\\' and \\'The Whitby Gazette\\', of \\nwhich I had made cuttings, had helped us  to understand the terrible events at \\nWhitby when Count Dracula landed, so I sh all look through the evening papers \\nsince then, and perhaps I shall get so me new light. I am not sleepy, and the \\nwork will help to keep me quiet.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n30 September.--Mr. Harker arrived at ni ne o\\'clock. He got his wife\\'s wire \\njust before starting. He is uncommonly cl ever, if one can judge from his face, \\nand full of energy. If this journal be tr ue, and judging by one\\'s own wonderful \\nexperiences, it must be, he is also a ma n of great nerve. That going down to the \\nvault a second time was a remarkable pie ce of daring. After reading his account \\nof it I was prepared to meet  a good specimen of manhoo d, but hardly the quiet, \\nbusinesslike gentleman who came here today.  \\nLATER.--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, \\nand as I passed a while ago I heard the clic k of the typewriter. They are hard at \\nit. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitti ng together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker ha s got the letters between the consignee \\nof the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He \\nis now reading his wife\\'s transcript of my diary. I wonder what they make out \\nof it. Here it is  \\nStrange that it never struck me tha t the very next house might be the \\nCount\\'s hiding place! Goodness knows that  we had enough clues from the \\nconduct of the patient Renfield! The bundl e of letters relating to the purchase \\nof the house were with the transcript. Oh, if we had only had them earlier we \\nmight have saved poor Lucy! Stop! That way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collecting material. He says that by dinner time they will be \\nable to show a whole conn ected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I \\nshould see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I ge t at the dates I suppose I \\nshall. What a good thing that Mrs. Hark er put my cylinders into type! We never \\ncould have found the dates otherwise.  \\nI found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling \\nbenignly. At the moment he seemed as sa ne as any one I ever saw. I sat down \\nand talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He \\nthen, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never \\nmentioned to my knowledge during his sojo urn here. In fact, he spoke quite \\nconfidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I not had the \\nchat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should \\nhave been prepared to sign for him afte r a brief time of observation. As it is, I \\nam darkly suspicious. All those out-bre aks were in some way linked with the \\nproximity of the Count. Wh at then does this absolu te content mean? Can it be \\nthat his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire\\'s ultimate triumph? Stay. He is \\nhimself zoophagous, and in his wild ravi ngs outside the chapel door of the \\ndeserted house he always spoke of \\'mas ter\\'. This all seems confirmation of our \\nidea. However, after a while I came away. My friend is just a little too sane at \\npresent to make it safe to probe him too de ep with questions. He might begin to \\nthink, and then So I came away. I mist rust these quiet moods of his, so I \\nhave given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait \\nwaistcoat ready in case of need.  \\nJOHNATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  29 September, in train to London. --When I received Mr. Billington\\'s \\ncourteous message that he would give me any information in his power I \\nthought it best to go down to Whitby and ma ke, on the spot, such inquiries as I \\nwanted. It was now my object to trace that  horrid cargo of the Count\\'s to its \\nplace in London. Later, we may be able to  deal with it. Billin gton junior, a nice \\nlad, met me at the station, and brough t me to his father\\'s house, where they had \\ndecided that I must spend the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire \\nhospitality, give a guest everything and le ave him to do as he likes. They all \\nknew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready \\nin his office all the papers concerning th e consignment of boxes. It gave me \\nalmost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count\\'s \\ntable before I knew of his diabolical  plans. Everything had been carefully \\nthought out, and done systematically an d with precision. He seemed to have \\nbeen prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way \\nof his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had \\'taken no \\nchances\\', and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled \\nwas simply the logical result of his care . I saw the invoice, and took note of it. \\n\\'Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes\\'. Also the \\ncopy of the letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply. Of both these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billing ton could give me, so I went down to \\nthe port and saw the coastguards, the Customs Officers and the harbour master, \\nwho kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add to the \\nsimple description \\'fifty cases of common earth\\', except that the boxes were \\n\\'main and mortal heavy\\', and that shif ting them was dry work. One of them \\nadded that it was hard lines that there wasn\\'t any gentleman \\'such like as like \\nyourself, squire\\', to show some sort of  appreciation of their efforts in a liquid \\nform. Another put in a rider that the thir st then generated was such that even \\nthe time which had elapsed had not comple tely allayed it. Needless to add, I \\ntook care before leaving to lift, forever a nd adequately, this source of reproach.  \\n30 September.--The station master was good enough to give me a line to \\nhis old companion the station master at King\\'s Cross, so that when I arrived \\nthere in the morning I was able to ask him  about the arrival of the boxes. He, \\ntoo put me at once in communication with  the proper officials, and I saw that \\ntheir tally was correct with the original  invoice. The opportunities of acquiring \\nan abnormal thirst had been here limited. A noble use of them had, however, \\nbeen made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in ex post facto \\nmanner.  From thence I went to Carter Paterson\\' s central office, where I met with \\nthe utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their  day book and letter \\nbook, and at once telephoned to their Ki ng\\'s Cross office for more details. By \\ngood fortune, the men who did the t eaming were waiting for work, and the \\nofficial at once sent them over, sendi ng also by one of them the way-bill and all \\nthe papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I \\nfound the tally agreeing exactly. The carri ers\\' men were able to supplement the \\npaucity of the written words with a few more details. These were, I shortly \\nfound, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and the \\nconsequent thirst engendered in the operato rs. On my affording an opportunity, \\nthrough the medium of the currency of th e realm, of the allaying, at a later \\nperiod, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked,  \\n\"That \\'ere \\'ouse, guv\\'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! But it ain\\'t \\nbeen touched sence a hundred years. Ther e was dust that thick in the place that \\nyou might have slep\\' on it without \\'urtin\\'  of yer bones. An\\' the place was that \\nneglected that yer might \\'ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the old chapel, that took the cike, that did! Me and my  mate, we thort we wouldn\\'t never git \\nout quick enough. Lor\\', I wouldn\\'t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.\"  \\nHaving been in the house, I could well  believe him, but if he knew what I \\nknow, he would, I think ha ve raised his terms.  \\nOf one thing I am now satisfied. That all those boxes which arrived at \\nWhitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed, as from Dr. Seward\\'s diary I fear.  \\nLater.--Mina and I have worked all da y, and we have put all the papers \\ninto order.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n30 September.--I am so  glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It \\nis, I suppose, the reaction from the ha unting fear which I have had, that this \\nterrible affair and the reopening of his  old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as could, but I was \\nsick with apprehension. The effort has,  however, done him good. He was never \\nso resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is \\njust as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is true grit, and he \\nimproves under strain that would kill a weak er nature. He came back full of life \\nand hope and determination. We have got ev erything in order for tonight. I feel \\nmyself quite wild with excitement. I su ppose one ought to pity anything so \\nhunted as the Count. That is just it. Th is thing is not human, not even a beast. \\nTo read Dr. Seward\\'s account of poor Lucy\\'s death, and what followed, is \\nenough to dry up the springs of pity in one\\'s heart.  \\nLater.--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. \\nDr. Seward was out on busin ess, and had taken Jonatha n with him, so I had to \\nsee them. It was to me a painful meeting,  for it brought back all poor dear \\nLucy\\'s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak \\nof me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsi ng, too, had been quite \\'blowing my \\ntrumpet\\', as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor  fellows, neither of them is aware that \\nI know all about the proposals they ma de to Lucy. They did not quite know \\nwhat to say or do, as they were ignor ant of the amount of my knowledge. So \\nthey had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and \\ncame to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them on \\naffairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward\\'s diary that they had been at Lucy\\'s death, her real death, and that I need not fear to betray any secret before \\nthe time. So I told them, as well as I c ould, that I had read all the papers and \\ndiaries, and that my husband and I, having  typewritten them, had just finished \\nputting them in order. I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When \\nLord Godalming got his and tur ned it over, it does make a pretty good pile, he \\nsaid, \"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?\"  \\nI nodded, and he went on.  \\n\"I don\\'t quite see the drift of it, but you people are all so good and kind, \\nand have been working so earnestly and so  energetically, that all I can do is to \\naccept your ideas blindfold and try to he lp you. I have ha d one lesson already \\nin accepting facts that  should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. \\nBesides, I know you loved my Lucy\"  \\nHere he turned away and covered hi s face with his hands. I could hear the \\ntears in his voice. Mr. Morri s, with instinctive delicacy , just laid a hand for a \\nmoment on his shoulder, and then walked  quietly out of the  room. I suppose there is something in a woman\\'s nature  that makes a man free to break down \\nbefore her and express his feelings on  the tender or emotional side without \\nfeeling it derogatory to his manhood. Fo r when Lord Godalming found himself \\nalone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat \\ndown beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn\\'t think it forward of me, and \\nthat if he ever thinks of it afterwards he  never will have such a thought. There I \\nwrong him. I know he never will. He is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I \\ncould see that his heart was breaking, \"I  loved dear Lucy, and I know what she \\nwas to you, and what you were to her. Sh e and I were like sisters, and now she \\nis gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in y our trouble? I know what \\nsorrows you have had, though I cannot meas ure the depth of them. If sympathy \\nand pity can help in your aff liction, won\\'t you let me be  of some little service, \\nfor Lucy\\'s sake?\"  \\nIn an instant the poor dear fellow wa s overwhelmed with grief. It seemed \\nto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. \\nHe grew quite hysterical, and raising his op en hands, beat his palms together in \\na perfect agony of grief. He stood up an d then sat down again, and the tears \\nrained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he  laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a \\nwearied child, whilst he  shook with emotion.  \\nWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above \\nsmaller matters when the mother spir it is invoked. I felt this big sorrowing \\nman\\'s head resting on me, as though it we re that of a baby that some day may \\nlie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair  as though he were my own child. I \\nnever thought at the time how strange it all was.  \\nAfter a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, \\nthough he made no disguise of his emotio n. He told me that for days and nights \\npast, weary days and sleepless nights, he had been unable to speak with any \\none, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no woman whose \\nsympathy could be given to him, or  with whom, owing to the terrible \\ncircumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely.  \\n\"I know now how I suffered,\" he said,  as he dried his eyes, \"but I do not \\nknow even yet, and none other can ever  know, how much yo ur sweet sympathy \\nhas been to me today. I shall know better in time, and believe me that, though I \\nam not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You \\nwill let me be like a brothe r, will you not, fo r all our lives, for dear Lucy\\'s \\nsake?\"  \"For dear Lucy\\'s sake,\" I said as we clasped hands. \"Ay, and for your own \\nsake,\" he added, \"for if a man\\'s es teem and gratitude are ever worth the \\nwinning, you have won mine today. If ever the  future should bring to you a \\ntime when you need a man\\'s help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God \\ngrant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life, \\nbut if it should ever come, promis e me that you will let me know.\"  \\nHe was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort \\nhim, so I said, \"I promise.\"  \\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr . Morris looking out of a window. \\nHe turned as he heard my footsteps. \"How  is Art?\" he said. Then noticing my \\nred eyes, he went on, \"Ah, I see yo u have been comforting him. Poor old \\nfellow! He needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble \\nof the heart, and he had no one to comfort him.\"  \\nHe bore his own trouble so bravely that  my heart bled for him. I saw the \\nmanuscript in his hand, and I knew that wh en he read it he would realize how \\nmuch I knew, so I said to him, \"I wish  I could comfort all who suffer from the \\nheart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You will know later why I speak.\"  \\nHe saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to \\nhis lips, kissed it. It seem ed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, \\nand impulsively I bent over and kissed hi m. The tears rose in his eyes, and \\nthere was a momentary choking in his throat. He said quite calmly, \"Little girl, \\nyou will never forget that true hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!\" Then \\nhe went into the study to his friend.  \\n\"Little girl!\" The very words he had us ed to Lucy, and, oh, but he proved \\nhimself a friend.  \\nCHAPTER 18  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n30 Se\\nptember.--I got home at five o\\'clock, and found that Godalming and \\nMorris had not only arrived, but had al ready studied the transcript of the \\nvarious diaries and letters which Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers\\' men, of whom Dr. Hennesse y had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave \\nus a cup of tea, and I can honestly say tha t, for the first time since I have lived \\nin it, this old house seemed like home. When  we had finished, Mrs. Harker said,  \\n\"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I wa nt to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. \\nDo let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary interests me so \\nmuch!\"  \\nShe looked so appealing and so pretty th at I could not refu se her, and there \\nwas no possible reason why I should, so  I took her with me. When I went into \\nthe room, I told the man that a lady woul d like to see him, to which he simply \\nanswered, \"Why?\"  \\n\"She is going through th e house, and wants to se e every one in it,\" I \\nanswered.  \\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said, \"let her co me in, by all means, but just wait a \\nminute till I tidy up the place.\"  \\nHis method of tidying was peculiar, he simply swallowed all the flies and \\nspiders in the boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, \\nor was jealous of, some interference. Wh en he had got thro ugh his disgusting \\ntask, he said cheerfully, \"Let the lady come in,\" and sat down on the edge of his \\nbed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent. \\nI remembered how quiet he had been jus t before he attacked me in my own \\nstudy, and I took care to stand where I co uld seize him at once if he attempted \\nto make a spring at her.  \\nShe came into the room with an easy gracefulness  which would at once \\ncommand the respect of any lunatic, fo r easiness is one of the qualities mad \\npeople most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantl y, and held out \\nher hand.  \\n\"Good evening, Mr. Renfield,\" said she. \"You see, I know you, for Dr. \\nSeward has told me of you.\" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one of wonder, \\nwhich merged in doubt, then to my inte nse astonishment he said, \"You\\'re not \\nthe girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can\\'t be, you know, for she\\'s \\ndead.\"  Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replie d, \"Oh no! I have a husband of my \\nown, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. \\nHarker.\"  \\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"  \\n\"My husband and I are staying on  a visit with Dr. Seward.\"  \\n\"Then don\\'t stay.\"  \"But why not?\"  \\nI thought that this style of conver sation might not be pleasant to Mrs. \\nHarker, any more than it was to me , so I joined in, \"How did you know I \\nwanted to marry anyone?\"  \\nHis reply was simply contemptuous, gi ven in a pause in which he turned \\nhis eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instant ly turning them back again, \"What an \\nasinine question!\"  \\n\"I don\\'t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\" said Mrs. Harker, at once \\nchampioning me.  \\nHe replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown \\ncontempt to me, \"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a \\nman is so loved and honour ed as our host is, everything regarding him is of \\ninterest in our little community. Dr. Sewa rd is loved not only by his household \\nand his friends, but even by his patients,  who, being some of them hardly in \\nmental equilibrium, are apt to distort caus es and effects. Since I myself have \\nbeen an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic \\ntendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenche.\"  \\nI positively opened my ey es at this new development. Here was my own \\npet lunatic, the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with, talking \\nelemental philosophy, and wi th the manner of a poli shed gentleman. I wonder \\nif it was Mrs. Harker\\'s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. \\nIf this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious \\ninfluence, she must have some rare gift or power.  \\nWe continued to talk for some time,  and seeing that he was seemingly \\nquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished , for he addressed himself \\nto the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity. He even took \\nhimself as an example when he mentioned certain things.  \\n\"Why, I myself am an in stance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, \\nit was no wonder that my friends were al armed, and insisted on my being put \\nunder control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and pe rpetual entity, and \\nthat by consuming a multitude of live things , no matter how low in the scale of \\ncreation, one might indefin itely prolong life. At times I held the belief so \\nstrongly that I actually tried to take hum an life. The doctor here will bear me \\nout that on one occasion I tried to kill hi m for the purpose of strengthening my \\nvital powers by the assimilation with my  own body of his life through the \\nmedium of his blood, relying of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, \\'For the blood is the life.\\' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has \\nvulgarized the truism to th e very point of contempt. Isn\\'t that true, doctor?\"  \\nI nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either \\nthink or say, it was hard to imagine that  I had seen him eat up his spiders and \\nflies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave.  \\nShe came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield, \"Goodbye, and I \\nhope I may see you often, under au spices pleasanter to yourself.\"  \\nTo which, to my astonishment, he re plied, \"Goodbye, my dear. I pray God \\nI may never see your sweet face agai n. May He bless and keep you!\"  \\nWhen I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me. \\nPoor Art seemed more cheerful than he ha s been since Lucy first took ill, and \\nQuincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day.  \\nVan Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy. \\nHe saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying, \"Ah, friend John, how goes \\nall? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be. All affairs \\nare settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. \\nAnd her so fine husband? And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with \\nyou, too? Good!\"  \\nAs I drove to the house I told him of wh at had passed, and of how my own \\ndiary had come to be of some use throu gh Mrs. Harker\\'s suggestion, at which \\nthe Professor interrupted me.  \"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She ha s man\\'s brain, a brain that a man \\nshould have were he mu ch gifted, and a woman\\'s heart. The good God \\nfashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good \\ncombination. Friend John, up to now fort une has made that woman of help to \\nus, after tonight she must not have to do w ith this so terrible affair. It is not \\ngood that she run a risk so great. We men are determined, nay, are we not \\npledged, to destroy this monster? But it is  no part for a woman. Even if she be \\nnot harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and \\nhereafter she may suffer, both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from \\nher dreams. And, besides, she is youn g woman and not so long married, there \\nmay be other things to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has \\nwrote all, then she must consult with us, but tomorrow she say goodbye to this \\nwork, and we go alone.\"  \\nI agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his \\nabsence, that the house w hich Dracula had bought was the  very next one to my \\nown. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him.  \\n\"Oh that we had known it before!\" he  said, \"for then we might have \\nreached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, \\'the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,\\' as you say. We shall no t think of that, but go on our way to the \\nend.\" Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker, \"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in \\nexact order all things that ha ve been, up to this moment.\"  \\n\"Not up to this moment, Professor,\" she said impulsively,  \"but up to this \\nmorning.\"  \\n\"But why not up to now? We have se en hitherto how good light all the \\nlittle things have made. We have told our  secrets, and yet no one who has told \\nis the worse for it.\"  \\nMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said, \\n\"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it  must go in. It is my record \\nof today. I too have seen the need of  putting down at pr esent everything, \\nhowever trivial, but there is little in this except what is personal. Must it go in?\"  \\nThe Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying, \"It need not \\ngo in if you do not wish it, but I pray that it may. It  can but make your husband \\nlove you the more, and all us, your friend s, more honour you, as well as more \\nesteem and love.\" She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.  And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete and \\nin order. The Professor took away one c opy to study after dinner, and before \\nour meeting, which is fixed for nine o\\'cloc k. The rest of us have already read \\neverything, so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts, \\nand can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n30 September.--When we met in Dr. Seward\\'s study two hours after dinner, \\nwhich had been at six o\\'clock, we unc onsciously formed a sort of board or \\ncommittee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. \\nSeward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit next to him on \\nhis right, and asked me to act as secretar y. Jonathan sat next  to me. Opposite us \\nwere Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris, Lord Godalming being \\nnext the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre.  \\nThe Professor said, \"I may, I suppos e, take it that we are all acquainted \\nwith the facts that are in these papers.\" We all expressed assent, and he went on, \\n\"Then it were, I think, good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with \\nwhich we have to deal. I shall then make known to you something of the \\nhistory of this man, which has been as certained for me. So we then can discuss \\nhow we shall act, and can take our measure according.  \\n\"There are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that they \\nexist. Even had we not the proof of our  own unhappy experience, the teachings \\nand the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at \\nthe first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have trained myself \\nto keep an open mind, I could not have believed until such time as that fact \\nthunder on my ear. \\'See! See! I prove, I prove.\\' Alas! Had I known at first what \\nnow I know, nay, had I even guess at him, one so precious life had been spared \\nto many of us who did love her. But that is gone, and we must so work, that \\nother poor souls perish n ot, whilst we can save. Th e nosferatu do not die like \\nthe bee when he sting once. He is only stronger, and being stronger, have yet \\nmore power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so \\nstrong in person as twenty men, he is  of cunning more than mortal, for his \\ncunning be the growth of ages, he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, \\nas his etymology imply, the divination by  the dead, and all the dead that he can \\ncome nigh to are for him at command; he is  brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the hear t of him is not; he can, within his range, direct the \\nelements, the storm, the fog, the thun der; he can command all the meaner \\nthings, the rat, and the owl, and the bat, the moth, and the fox, and the wolf, he \\ncan grow and become small; and he can  at times vanish and come unknown. \\nHow then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his \\nwhere, and having found it, how can we de stroy? My friends, this is much, it is \\na terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this ou r fight he must surely win, and then \\nwhere end we? Life is nothing s, I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life \\nor death. It is that we become as him , that we henceforward become foul things \\nof the night like him, w ithout heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and \\nthe souls of those we love best. To us fo rever are the gates of heaven shut, for \\nwho shall open them to us again? We go on  for all time abhorred by all, a blot \\non the face of God\\'s sunshine, an arrow in the si de of Him who died for man. \\nBut we are face to face with duty, and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say no, but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of \\nbirds, his music and his love, lie far behin d. You others are young. Some have \\nseen sorrow, but there are fair days yet in store. What say you?\"  \\nWhilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so much, \\nthat the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out, but it was life to me to feel its touch, so stro ng, so self reliant, \\nso resolute. A brave man\\'s hand can speak for itself, it does not even need a woman\\'s love to hear its music.  \\nWhen the Professor had done speaki ng my husband looked in my eyes, \\nand I in his, there was no ne ed for speaking between us.  \\n\"I answer for Mina and myself,\" he said.  \\n\"Count me in, Professor,\" said Mr. Q uincey Morris, laconically as usual.  \\n\"I am with you,\" said Lord Godalming,  \"for Lucy\\'s sake, if for no other \\nreason.\"  \\nDr. Seward simply nodded.  \\nThe Professor stood up and, after la ying his golden crucifix on the table, \\nheld out his hand on either side. I too k his right hand, and Lord Godalming his \\nleft, Jonathan held my right with his le ft and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So \\nas we all took hands our solemn comp act was made. I felt my heart icy cold, \\nbut it did not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of chee rfulness which showed that the serious \\nwork had begun. It was to be taken as gr avely, and in as businesslike a way, as \\nany other transaction of life.  \\n\"Well, you know what we have to contend against, but we too, are not \\nwithout strength. We have  on our side power of co mbination, a power denied \\nto the vampire kind, we have  sources of science, we are free to act and think, \\nand the hours of the day and the night ar e ours equally. In fact, so far as our \\npowers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. We have self \\ndevotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These \\nthings are much.  \\n\"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, \\nand how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the limitations of the \\nvampire in general, and of this one in particular.  \\n\"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at \\nthe first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death, nay of more \\nthan either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied, in the first place because we have to be, no other means is at our cont rol, and secondly, because, after all \\nthese things, tradition and superstition, are everything. Does not the belief in \\nvampires rest for others, though not, alas ! for us, on them? A year ago which of \\nus would have received such a possibi lity, in the midst of our scientific, \\nsceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth centur y? We even scouted a belief that we \\nsaw justified under our very eyes. Take it , then, that the vampire, and the belief \\nin his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old \\nRome, he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chermosese, and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the \\npeoples for him at this day. He have foll ow the wake of the berserker Icelander, \\nthe devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar.  \\n\"So far, then, we have all we may act  upon, and let me tell you that very \\nmuch of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time, \\nhe can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, \\nwe have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger, that his vital faculties \\ngrow strenuous, and seem as though they  refresh themselves when his special \\npabulum is plenty.  \\n\"But he cannot flourish without this diet, he eat not as others. Even friend \\nJonathan, who lived with him for weeks,  did never see him eat, never! He throws no shadow, he make in the mirror no  reflect, as again Jonathan observe. \\nHe has the strength of many of his hand , witness again Jonathan when he shut \\nthe door against the wolves, and when he help him from the diligence too. He \\ncan transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, \\nwhen he tear open the dog, he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the \\nwindow at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from  this so near house, and \\nas my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy.  \\n\"He can come in mist which he create, that noble ship\\'s captain proved him \\nof this, but, from what we know, the dist ance he can make this mist is limited, \\nand it can only be round himself.  \\n\"He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again Jonathan saw \\nthose sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small, we ourselves saw \\nMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his wa y, come out from anything or into \\nanything, no matter how close it be boun d or even fused up with fire, solder \\nyou call it. He can see in th e dark, no small power this , in a world which is one \\nhalf shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through.  \\n\"He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay, he is even more \\nprisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go \\nwhere he lists, he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature\\'s laws, why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some \\none of the household who bid him to come, though afterwards he can come as \\nhe please. His power ceases, as does that of  all evil things, at the coming of the \\nday.  \\n\"Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the \\nplace whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact \\nsunrise or sunset. These things we are tol d, and in this record of ours we have \\nproof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when \\nhe have his earth-home, his coffin-hom e, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, \\nas we saw when he went to the grave of  the suicide at Whitby, still at other \\ntime he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things \\nwhich so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of, and as \\nfor things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now \\nwhen we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, \\nlest in our seeking we may need them.  \"The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it, a \\nsacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead, and as for the \\nstake through him, we know already of its peace, or the cut off head that giveth \\nrest. We have seen it with our eyes.  \\n\"Thus when we find the habitation of  this man-that-was, we can confine \\nhim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is clever. I \\nhave asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record, \\nand from all the means that are, he tell  me of what he has been. He must, \\nindeed, have been that Voivode Dracula  who won his name against the Turk, \\nover the great river on the very frontier of  Turkeyland. If it be so, then was he \\nno common man, for in that time, and for ce nturies after, he was spoken of as \\nthe cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the \\n\\'land beyond the forest.\\' That mighty br ain and that iron resolution went with \\nhim to his grave, and are even now arra yed against us. The Draculas were, says \\nArminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his \\nsecrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, \\nwhere the devil claims the tenth schola r as his due. In the records are such \\nwords as \\'stregoica\\' witch, \\'ordog\\' and \\'pokol\\' Satan and hell, and in one \\nmanuscript this very Dracula is spoken of  as \\'wampyr,\\' which we all understand \\ntoo well. There have been from the loin s of this very one great men and good \\nwomen, and their graves make sacred th e earth where alone this foulness can \\ndwell. For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all \\ngood, in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\"  \\nWhilst they were talking Mr. Morri s was looking steadily at the window, \\nand he now got up quietly, a nd went out of the room. There was a little pause, \\nand then the Professor went on.  \\n\"And now we must settle what we do.  We have here much data, and we \\nmust proceed to lay out our campaign. We  know from the in quiry of Jonathan \\nthat from the castle to Whitby came fif ty boxes of earth, all of which were \\ndelivered at Carfax, we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all \\nthe rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today, or whether \\nany more have been removed. If the latter, we must trace\"  \\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came \\nthe sound of a pistol shot, the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, \\nwhich ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the \\nroom. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their feet, Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up \\nthe sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morri s\\' voice without, \"Sorry! I fear I have \\nalarmed you. I shall come  in and tell you about it.\"  \\nA minute later he came in and said, \"I t was an idiotic thing of me to do, \\nand I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely, I fear I must have \\nfrightened you terribly. But th e fact is that whilst the Professor was talking \\nthere came a big bat and sat on the window sill. I have got such a horror of the \\ndamned brutes from recent events that  I cannot stand them, and I went out to \\nhave a shot, as I have been doing of late  of evenings, whenever I have seen one. \\nYou used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\"  \\n\"Did you hit it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing.  \\n\"I don\\'t know, I fancy not, for it flew  away into the wood .\" Without saying \\nany more he took his seat, and the Prof essor began to resume his statement.  \\n\"We must trace each of these boxes, and when we are ready, we must \\neither capture or kill this monster in his la ir, or we must, so to speak, sterilize \\nthe earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the end we may find \\nhim in his form of man between the ho urs of noon and sunset, and so engage \\nwith him when he is at his most weak.  \\n\"And now for you, Madam Mina, this ni ght is the end until all be well. \\nYou are too precious to us to have such risk. When we  part tonight, you no \\nmore must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men and are \\nable to bear, but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the \\nmore free that you are not in the danger, such as we are.\"  \\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but it did not seem to me \\ngood that they should brave danger and, perhaps lessen their safety, strength \\nbeing the best safety, through care of me, but their minds were made up, and \\nthough it was a bitter pill fo r me to swallow, I could sa y nothing, save to accept \\ntheir chivalrous care of me.  \\nMr. Morris resumed the discussion, \"As there is no time to lose, I vote we \\nhave a look at his house right now. Time is everything with him, and swift \\naction on our part may save another victim.\"  \\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so \\nclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a \\ndrag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone  off to Carfax, with means to get into \\nthe house.  \\nManlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep, as if a woman can sleep \\nwhen those she loves are in danger! I sh all lie down, and pretend to sleep, lest \\nJonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n1 October, 4 A.M.--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent \\nmessage was brought to me from Renfie ld to know if I would see him at once, \\nas he had something of the utmost importance to say to me. I told the \\nmessenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning, I was busy \\njust at the moment.  \\nThe attendant added, \"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen \\nhim so eager. I don\\'t know but what, if you don\\'t se e him soon, he will have \\none of his violent fits.\" I knew the man wo uld not have said this without some \\ncause, so I said, \"All rig ht, I\\'ll go now,\" and I aske d the others to wait a few \\nminutes for me, as I had to go and see my patient.  \\n\"Take me with you, friend John,\" sa id the Professor. \"His case in your \\ndiary interest me much, and it had bear ing, too, now and again on our case. I \\nshould much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed.\"  \\n\"May I come also?\" asked Lord Godalming.  \\n\"Me too?\" said Quincey Morris. \"May I come?\" said Harker. I nodded, and \\nwe all went down the passage together.  \\nWe found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational \\nin his speech and manner th an I had ever seen him. There was an unusual \\nunderstanding of himself, which was unlik e anything I had ever met with in a \\nlunatic, and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others \\nentirely sane. We all five went into the room, but none of the others at first said \\nanything. His request was that I would at  once release him from the asylum and \\nsend him home. This he backed up wi th arguments regarding his complete \\nrecovery, and adduced his own existing sanity.  \"I appeal to your friends,\" he said, \" they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in \\njudgement on my case. By the way, you have not introduced me.\"  \\nI was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an \\nasylum did not strike me at the mome nt, and besides, there was a certain \\ndignity in the man\\'s manner, so much of the habit of equality,  that I at once \\nmade the introduction, \"Lord Godalming,  Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey \\nMorris, of Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr. Renfield.\"  \\nHe shook hands with each of them, saying in turn, \"Lord Godalming, I had \\nthe honour of seconding your father at  the Windham; I grieve to know, by your \\nholding the title, that he is no more. He was a man loved and honoured by all \\nwho knew him, and in his yo uth was, I have heard, th e inventor of a burnt rum \\npunch, much patronized on Derby nig ht. Mr. Morris, you s hould be proud of \\nyour great state. Its reception into the Union was a preced ent which may have \\nfar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance \\nto the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of \\nenlargement, when the Monroe doctrine ta kes its true place as  a political fable. \\nWhat shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no \\napology for dropping all forms of conven tional prefix. When an individual has \\nrevolutionized therapeutic s by his discovery of the continuous evolution of \\nbrain matter, conventional forms are unf itting, since they would seem to limit \\nhim to one of a class. You, gentlemen,  who by nationality, by heredity, or by \\nthe possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men \\nwho are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, \\nhumanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem  it a moral duty to \\ndeal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.\" He made this last appeal with a courtly ai r of conviction whic h was not without its \\nown charm.  \\nI think we were all staggered. For my  own part, I was under the conviction, \\ndespite my knowledge of the man\\'s charact er and history, that his reason had \\nbeen restored, and I felt under a strong im pulse to tell him that I was satisfied \\nas to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in \\nthe morning. I thought it better to wa it, however, before making so grave a \\nstatement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So I contented myself w ith making a general statement that he \\nappeared to be improving very rapidly, that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then s ee what I could do in the direction of \\nmeeting his wishes.  This did not at all satisfy him, for he  said quickly, \"But I fear, Dr. Seward, \\nthat you hardly apprehend my wish. I desi re to go at once, here, now, this very \\nhour, this very moment, if I may. Time  presses, and in our implied agreement \\nwith the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only \\nnecessary to put before so admirable a pr actitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet \\nso momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\"  \\nHe looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the \\nothers, and scrutinized them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he \\nwent on, \"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\"  \\n\"You have,\" I said frankly, but at the  same time, as I felt, brutally.  \\nThere was a considerable pause, and th en he said slowly, \"Then I suppose \\nI must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for this concession, boon, \\nprivilege, what you will. I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal \\ngrounds, but for the sake of others. I am  not at liberty to give you the whole of \\nmy reasons, but you may, I assure you, ta ke it from me that they are good ones, \\nsound and unselfish, and spring fr om the highest sense of duty.  \\n\"Could you look, sir, into my heart,  you would approve to the full the \\nsentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the \\nbest and truest of your friends.\"  \\nAgain he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing conviction that this \\nsudden change of his entire intellect ual method was but yet another phase of \\nhis madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longe r, knowing from \\nexperience that he would, like all lunatics, give himse lf away in the end. Van \\nHelsing was gazing at him with a look of  utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows \\nalmost meeting with the fixed concentratio n of his look. He said to Renfield in \\na tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it \\nafterwards, for it was as of one addressi ng an equal, \"Can you not tell frankly \\nyour real reason for wishing to be free tonight? I will undert ake that if you will \\nsatisfy even me, a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind, Dr. Seward will give you,  at his own risk and on his own \\nresponsibility, the pr ivilege you seek.\"  \\nHe shook his head sadly,  and with a look of poi gnant regret on his face. \\nThe Professor went on, \"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree,  since you seek to impres s us with your complete \\nreasonableness. You do this, whose sanity  we have reason to doubt, since you \\nare not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty \\nwhich you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help us, and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\"  \\nHe still shook his head as he said, \"D r. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. \\nYour argument is complete, and if I were  free to speak I should not hesitate a \\nmoment, but I am not my own master in th e matter. I can only ask you to trust \\nme. If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\"  \\nI thought it was now time to end th e scene, which was becoming too \\ncomically grave, so I went towards the d oor, simply saying, \"Come, my friends, \\nwe have work to do. Goodnight.\"  \\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He \\nmoved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to \\nmake another homicidal attack. My fear s, however, were groundless, for he \\nheld up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. \\nAs he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by \\nrestoring us more to our o ld relations, he became still more demonstrative. I \\nglanced at Van Helsing, and saw my c onviction reflected in his eyes, so I \\nbecame a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the \\nsame constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request \\nof which at the time he had thought much, such for instance, as when he \\nwanted a cat, and I was prepared to se e the collapse into the same sullen \\nacquiescence on this occasion.  \\nMy expectation was not realized, for when he found that his appeal would \\nnot be successful, he got into quite a fra ntic condition. He thr ew himself on his \\nknees, and held up his hands, wringin g them in plaintive supplication, and \\npoured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and \\nhis whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion.  \\n\"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh,  let me implore you, to let me out of \\nthis house at once. Send me away how  you will and wher e you will, send \\nkeepers with me with whips and chains, let them take me in a strait waistcoat, \\nmanacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol, but let me go out of  this. You don\\'t \\nknow what you do by keeping me here. I am speaking from the depths of my \\nheart, of my very soul. You don\\'t know whom you wrong, or how, and I may \\nnot tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear, \\nby your love that is lost, by your hope that lives, for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul fr om guilt! Can\\'t you h ear me, man? Can\\'t you understand? Will you never learn?  Don\\'t you know that I am sane and \\nearnest now, that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his \\nsoul? Oh, hear me! Hear me! Let me go, let me go, let me go!\"  \\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he w ould get, and so \\nwould bring on a fit, so I took him by the hand and raised him up.  \\n\"Come,\" I said sternly, \"no more of this, we have had quite enough already. \\nGet to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\"  \\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me  intently for several moments. Then, \\nwithout a word, he rose and moving over , sat down on the side of the bed. The \\ncollapse had come, as on former o ccasions, just as I had expected.  \\nWhen I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, \\nwell-bred voice, \"You will, I trust, Dr . Seward, do me the justice to bear in \\nmind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you tonight.\"  \\nCHAPTER 19  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n1 October,\\n 5 A.M.--I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, \\nfor I think I never saw Mina so absolutely st rong and well. I am so glad that she \\nconsented to hold back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to \\nme that she was in this f earful business at all, but now that her work is done, \\nand that it is due to her energy and brains  and foresight that the whole story is \\nput together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part \\nis finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his \\nroom we were silent till we  got back to the study.  \\nThen Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward , \"Say, Jack, if that man wasn\\'t \\nattempting a bluff, he is about the sanest  lunatic I ever saw. I\\'m not sure, but I \\nbelieve that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on \\nhim not to get a chance.\"  \\nLord Godalming and I were silent, bu t Dr. Van Helsing added, \"Friend \\nJohn, you know more lunatics than I do, a nd I\\'m glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given \\nhim free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, \\nas my friend Quincey would say.  All is best as they are.\"  \\nDr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way, \"I don\\'t \\nknow but that I agree with you. If that ma n had been an ordinary lunatic I \\nwould have taken my chance of trus ting him, but he seems so mixed up with \\nthe Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by \\nhelping his fads. I can\\'t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat, \\nand then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count \\n\\'lord and master\\', and he may want to  get out to help him in some diabolical \\nway. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, \\nso I suppose he isn\\'t above trying to us e a respectable lunatic. He certainly did \\nseem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in \\nconjunction with the wild wo rk we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.\"  \\nThe Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in \\nhis grave, kindly way, \"Friend John, have  no fear. We are trying to do our duty \\nin a very sad and terrible case, we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?\"  \\nLord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned. \\nHe held up a little silver whistle as he remarked, \"That old place may be full of \\nrats, and if so, I\\'ve got an antidote on call.\"  \\nHaving passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep \\nin the shadows of the trees on the lawn  when the moonlight shone out. When \\nwe got to the porch the Professor opened  his bag and took ou t a lot of things, \\nwhich he laid on the step, sorting them int o four little groups,  evidently one for \\neach. Then he spoke.  \\n\"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of \\nmany kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the \\nstrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the \\ncommon kind, and therefore breakable or  crushable, his are not amenable to \\nmere strength. A stronger man, or a bo dy of men more strong in all than him, \\ncan at certain times hold him, but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch. K eep this near your \\nheart.\" As he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being \\nnearest to him, \"put these flowers round your neck,\" here he handed to me a \\nwreath of withered garlic blossoms, \"f or other enemies more mundane, this \\nrevolver and this knife, and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast, and for all,  and above all at the last, this, which \\nwe must not desecrate needless.\"  \\nThis was a portion of Sacred Wafer,  which he put in an envelope and \\nhanded to me. Each of the othe rs was similarly equipped.  \\n\"Now,\" he said, \"friend John, where are the skeleton keys? If so that we \\ncan open the door, we need not break ho use by the window, as before at Miss \\nLucy\\'s.\"  \\nDr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a \\nsurgeon standing him in good stead. Presen tly he got one to s uit, after a little \\nplay back and forward the bolt yielded, and with a rusty cla ng, shot back. We \\npressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was \\nstartlingly like the image conveyed to me  in Dr. Seward\\'s diary of the opening \\nof Miss Westenra\\'s tomb, I fancy that the  same idea seemed to strike the others, \\nfor with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move \\nforward, and stepped into the open door.  \\n\"In manus tuas, Domine!\" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the \\nthreshold. We closed the door behind us , lest when we should have lit our \\nlamps we should possibly attract at tention from the road. The Professor \\ncarefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should \\nwe be in a hurry making our exit. Then  we all lit our lamps and proceeded on \\nour search.  \\nThe light from the tiny lamps fell in a ll sorts of odd forms, as the rays \\ncrossed each other, or the opacity of ou r bodies threw great  shadows. I could \\nnot for my life get away from the feelin g that there was someone else amongst \\nus. I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the \\ngrim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the \\nfeeling was common to us all, for I notic ed that the others kept looking over \\ntheir shoulders at every sound and ev ery new shadow, just as I felt myself \\ndoing.  \\nThe whole place was thick with dust. Th e floor was seemingly inches deep, \\nexcept where there were recent footsteps,  in which on holdi ng down my lamp I \\ncould see marks of hobnails where the dust  was cracked. The walls were fluffy \\nand heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider\\'s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in th e hall was a great bunch of keys, with a \\ntime-yellowed label on each. They had been  used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when \\nthe Professor lifted them.  \\nHe turned to me and said, \"You know  this place, Jonathan. You have \\ncopied maps of it, and you know it at l east more than we do. Which is the way \\nto the chapel?\"  \\nI had an idea of its direction, though on  my former visit I had not been able \\nto get admission to it, so I led the wa y, and after a few wrong turnings found \\nmyself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.  \\n\"This is the spot,\" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map \\nof the house, copied from the file of my  original correspondence regarding the \\npurchase. With a little trou ble we found the key on the bunch and opened the \\ndoor. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the \\ndoor a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us \\never expected such an odour  as we encountered. None of the others had met the \\nCount at all at close quarters, and when  I had seen him he was either in the \\nfasting stage of his existence in his ro oms or, when he was bloated with fresh \\nblood, in a ruined building open to the air, but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an \\nearthy smell, as of some dry miasma, w hich came through the fouler air. But as \\nto the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was \\ncomposed of all the ills of mortality a nd with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, \\nbut it seemed as though corru ption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! It sickens \\nme to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to \\nthe place and intensified its loathsomeness.  \\nUnder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our \\nenterprise to an end, but th is was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible \\npurpose in which we were involved ga ve us a strength which rose above \\nmerely physical considerations. After the  involuntary shrink ing consequent on \\nthe first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that \\nloathsome place were a garden of roses.  \\nWe made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we \\nbegan, \"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left, we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny  and see if we cannot get some clue \\nas to what has become of the rest.\"  \\nA glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth \\nchests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.  There were only twenty-n ine left out of the fifty!  Once I got a fright, for, \\nseeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the \\ndark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. \\nSomewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the \\nCount\\'s evil face, the ridge of the nose , the red eyes, the red lips, the awful \\npallor. It was only for a moment, for, as  Lord Godalming said, \"I thought I saw \\na face, but it was only the shadows,\" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp \\nin the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of anyone, and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding place even for him. I took it that \\nfear had helped imaginatio n, and said nothing.  \\nA few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which \\nhe was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was grow ing on us, and we saw a whole mass \\nof phosphorescence, which twinkled like st ars. We all instinctively drew back. \\nThe whole place was becoming alive with rats.  \\nFor a moment or two we stood appa lled, all save Lord Godalming, who \\nwas seemingly prepared for such an emer gency. Rushing over to the great iron-\\nbound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and \\nwhich I had seen myself, he turned the ke y in the lock, drew th e huge bolts, and \\nswung the door open. Then, taking his little  silver whistle from his pocket, he \\nblew a low, shrill call. It was answered  from behind Dr. Seward\\'s house by the \\nyelping of dogs, and after about a minute  three terriers came dashing round the \\ncorner of the house. Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as \\nwe moved I noticed that the dust had been  much disturbed. The boxes which \\nhad been taken out had been brought thi s way. But even in the minute that had \\nelapsed the number of the rats had va stly increased. They seemed to swarm \\nover the place all at once, till the lamp light, shining on their moving dark \\nbodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set \\nwith fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and \\nsnarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most \\nlugubrious fashion. The rats were multiply ing in thousands, and we moved out.  \\nLord Godalming lifted one of the dogs , and carrying him in, placed him on \\nthe floor. The instant his feet touche d the ground he seemed to recover his \\ncourage, and rushed at his natural enemie s. They fled before him so fast that \\nbefore he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now \\nbeen lifted in the same manner, had bu t small prey ere the whole mass had \\nvanished.  With their going it seemed as if so me evil presence had departed, for the \\ndogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their \\nprostrate foes, and turned them over an d over and tossed them in the air with \\nvicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the \\npurifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the \\nrelief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not, but \\nmost certainly the shadow of dread seemed  to slip from us like a robe, and the \\noccasion of our coming lost something of  its grim significance, though we did \\nnot slacken a whit in our re solution. We closed the outer door and barred and \\nlocked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We \\nfound nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all \\nuntouched save for my own footsteps wh en I had made my first visit. Never \\nonce did the dogs exhibit any sympto m of uneasiness, and even when we \\nreturned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit \\nhunting in a summer wood.  \\nThe morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front. \\nDr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.  \\n\"So far,\" he said, \"our night has been eminently successful. No harm has \\ncome to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many \\nboxes are missing. More than all do I rej oice that this, our first, and perhaps our \\nmost difficult and dangerous, step has been accomplished wi thout the bringing \\nthereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or  troubling her wa king or sleeping \\nthoughts with sights and sounds and sm ells of horror which she might never \\nforget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari, \\nthat the brute beasts whic h are to the Count\\'s command are yet themselves not \\namenable to his spiritual power, for look,  these rats that would come to his call, \\njust as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor \\nmother\\'s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have o ther matters before us, other dangers, \\nother fears, and that monster He has not used his power over the brute world \\nfor the only or the last time tonight. So  be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! \\nIt has given us opportunity to cry \\'ch eck\\' in some ways in this chess game, \\nwhich we play for the stak e of human souls. And now let us go home. The \\ndawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night\\'s work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to  follow, if full \\nof peril, but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\"  \\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who \\nwas screaming away in one of the dis tant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield\\'s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after \\nthe manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.  \\nI came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so \\nsoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than usual. I \\nhope the meeting tonight ha s not upset her. I am truly thankful that she is to be \\nleft out of our future work, and even of our deliberations. It is too great a strain \\nfor a woman to bear. I did not think so  at first, but I know better now. \\nTherefore I am glad that it is settled.  There may be things which would frighten \\nher to hear, and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if \\nonce she suspected that there was any c oncealment. Henceforth our work is to \\nbe a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is \\nfinished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I daresay it will \\nbe difficult to begin to keep silence afte r such confidence as ours, but I must be \\nresolute, and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonight\\'s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb \\nher.  \\n1 October, later.--I suppose it was natural that we s hould have all overslept \\nourselves, for the day was a busy one, a nd the night had no rest at all. Even \\nMina must have felt its ex haustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I \\nwas awake before her, and had to call tw o or three times before she awoke. \\nIndeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize \\nme, but looked at me with a sort of blank  terror, as one lo oks who has been \\nwaked out of a bad dream. She complained  a little of being tired, and I let her \\nrest till later in the day. We now kn ow of twenty-one boxes having been \\nremoved, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may \\nbe able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labor, \\nand the sooner the matter is attended to  the better. I shall look up Thomas \\nSnelling today.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n1 October.--It was towards noon when  I was awakened by the Professor \\nwalking into my room. He was more joll y and cheerful than usual, and it is \\nquite evident that last night\\'s work ha s helped to take some of the brooding \\nweight off his mind.  After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said, \"Your patient \\ninterests me much. May it be that with you I visit him this morning? Or if that \\nyou are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to \\nfind a lunatic who talk philos ophy, and reason so sound.\"  \\nI had some work to do which pressed,  so I told him that if he would go \\nalone I would be glad, as then I should  not have to keep him waiting, so I \\ncalled an attendant and ga ve him the necessary instructions. Before the \\nProfessor left the room I cautioned him  against getting an y false impression \\nfrom my patient.  \\n\"But,\" he answered, \"I want him to talk of  himself and of hi s delusion as to \\nconsuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of \\nyesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you sm ile, friend John?\"  \\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but the answer is here.\" I laid my hand on the \\ntypewritten matter. \"When our sane and learned lunatic made that very \\nstatement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous \\nwith the flies and spiders which he had eat en just before Mrs. Harker entered \\nthe room.\"  \\nVan Helsing smiled in turn. \"Good!\" he said. \"Your memory is true, friend \\nJohn. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very ob liquity of thought \\nand memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I \\nmay gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the \\nteaching of the most wise. Who knows?\"  \\nI went on with my work, and before  long was through that in hand. It \\nseemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing \\nback in the study.  \\n\"Do I interrupt?\" he asked polite ly as he stood at the door.  \\n\"Not at all,\" I answered. \"Come in. My work is finished, and I am free. I \\ncan go with you now, if you like.\"  \\n\"It is needless, I have seen him!\"  \\n\"Well?\"  \\n\"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short. \\nWhen I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him as \\ncheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He \\nmade no reply whatever. \\'Don\\'t you know  me?\\' I asked. His answer was not \\nreassuring: \\'I know you well  enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish \\nyou would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn \\nall thick-headed Dutchmen!\\' Not a wo rd more would he say, but sat in his \\nimplacable sullenness as in different to me as though I had not been in the room \\nat all. Thus departed for this time my  chance of much learning from this so \\nclever lunatic, so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Frie nd John, it does rejoice me unspeakable \\nthat she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things. \\nThough we shall much miss her help, it is better so.\"  \\n\"I agree with you with all my heart,\" I answered earnestly, for I did not \\nwant him to weaken in this matter. \"Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight \\nplaces in our time, but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in \\ntouch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her.\"  \\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer w ith Mrs. Harker and Harker, Quincey \\nand Art are all out following up the clues as  to the earth boxes. I shall finish my \\nround of work and we shall meet tonight.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n1 October.--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am today, after \\nJonathan\\'s full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid \\ncertain matters, and those the most vital of  all. This morning I slept late after \\nthe fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonath an was late too, he was the earlier. \\nHe spoke to me before he went out, ne ver more sweetly or tenderly, but he \\nnever mentioned a word of what had happ ened in the visit to the Count\\'s house. \\nAnd yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I \\nsuppose it must have distressed him even  more than it did me. They all agreed \\nthat it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I \\nacquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am crying \\nlike a silly fool, when I know it comes from my husband\\'s great love and from \\nthe good, good wishes of those other strong men.  That has done me good. Well, some da y Jonathan will tell me all. And lest \\nit should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from \\nhim, I still keep my journal as usual. Then  if he has feared of my trust I shall \\nshow it to him, with every thought of my heart put do wn for his dear eyes to \\nread. I feel strangely sad and low-spirited today. I suppose it is the reaction \\nfrom the terrible excitement.  \\nLast night I went to bed when the me n had gone, simply because they told \\nme to. I didn\\'t feel sleepy, and I did f eel full of devouring anxiety. I kept \\nthinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in \\nLondon, and it all seems like a horribl e tragedy, with fate pressing on \\nrelentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter \\nhow right it may be, to bring on the very  thing which is most to be deplored. If \\nI hadn\\'t gone to Whitby, pe rhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. She \\nhadn\\'t taken to visiting the churchyard ti ll I came, and if she hadn\\'t come there \\nin the day time with me she wouldn\\'t have walked in her sleep. And if she \\nhadn\\'t gone there at night and asleep, th at monster couldn\\'t have destroyed her \\nas he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder \\nwhat has come over me today. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one mornin g I, who never cried on my own \\naccount, and whom he has never caused to  shed a tear, the dear fellow would \\nfret his heart out. I shal l put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall \\nnever see it. I suppose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to \\nlearn  \\nI can\\'t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the \\nsudden barking of the dogs and a lot of  queer sounds, like praying on a very \\ntumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield\\'s room, which is somewhere under this. \\nAnd then there was silence over everything , silence so profound that it startled \\nme, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the \\nblack shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of \\ntheir own. Not a thing seemed to be stir ring, but all to be grim and fixed as \\ndeath or fate, so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost \\nimperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a \\nsentience and a vitality of its own. I thi nk that the digress ion of my thoughts \\nmust have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy \\ncreeping over me. I lay a while, but coul d not quite sleep, so I got out and \\nlooked out of the window again. The mi st was spreading, and was now close up \\nto the house, so that I cou ld see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were \\nstealing up to the windows. The poor ma n was more loud than ever, and though \\nI could not distinguish a word he said, I could in so me way recognize in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a \\nstruggle, and I knew that the attendant s were dealing with him. I was so \\nfrightened that I crept into bed, and pull ed the clothes over my head, putting \\nmy fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought, but I \\nmust have fallen asleep, for except dr eams, I do not remember anything until \\nthe morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a \\nlittle time to realize where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending \\nover me. My dream was very peculiar, an d was almost typical of the way that \\nwaking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.  \\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiti ng for Jonathan to come back. I was \\nvery anxious about him, and I was powerless to act, my feet, and my hands, \\nand my brain were weighted, so that no thing could proceed at the usual pace. \\nAnd so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the air \\nwas heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back  the clothes from my face, and found, \\nto my surprise, that all was dim around.  The gaslight which I had left lit for \\nJonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, \\nwhich had evidently grown thicker and po ured into the room. Then it occurred \\nto me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got \\nout to make certain on the point, but some  leaden lethargy seemed to chain my \\nlimbs and even my will. I lay still and en dured, that was all. I closed my eyes, \\nbut could still see thr ough my eyelids. (It is wonder ful what tricks our dreams \\nplay us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and \\nthicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke, or \\nwith the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, not through the window, but \\nthrough the joinings of the door . It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it \\nbecame concentrated into a sort of pilla r of cloud in the room, through the top \\nof which I could see the ligh t of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to \\nwhirl through my brain just as the cl oudy column was now whirling in the \\nroom, and through it all came the scriptur al words \"a pillar of cloud by day and \\nof fire by night.\" Was it indeed such sp iritual guidance that was coming to me \\nin my sleep? But the pillar was composed  of both the day and the night guiding, \\nfor the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for \\nme, till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the \\nfog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. \\nMary\\'s Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that \\nJonathan had seen those awful wome n growing into real ity through the \\nwhirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all \\nbecame black darkness. The last consciou s effort which imagination made was \\nto show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist.  I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one\\'s reason if \\nthere were too much of them. I would ge t Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to \\nprescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to \\nalarm them. Such a dream at the prese nt time would become woven into their \\nfears for me. Tonight I shall strive hard  to sleep naturally. If I do not, I shall \\ntomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral, that cannot hurt me for \\nonce, and it will give me a good night\\'s sleep. Last night tired me more than if I \\nhad not slept at all.  \\n2 October 10 P.M.--Last nigh t I slept, but did not dr eam. I must have slept \\nsoundly, for I was not waked by Jonath an coming to bed, but the sleep has not \\nrefreshed me, for today I feel terribly w eak and spiritless. I spent all yesterday \\ntrying to read, or lying down dozing. In the  afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he \\nmight see me. Poor man, he was very ge ntle, and when I came away he kissed \\nmy hand and bade God bless me. Some way it affected me much. I am crying \\nwhen I think of him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. \\nJonathan would be miserable if he kne w I had been crying. He and the others \\nwere out till dinner time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to \\nbrighten them up, and I suppose that th e effort did me good, for I forgot how \\ntired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, \\nas they said, but I knew th at they wanted to tell each other of what had \\noccurred to each during the day. I could see from Jonathan\\'s manner that he had something important to communicate. I wa s not so sleepy as I should have been, \\nso before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was \\nvery mild I have taken it, and am wa iting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I \\nhope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of \\nwaking. I might want it. Here  comes sleep. Goodnight.  \\nCHAPTER 20  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n1 October,\\n evening.--I found Thomas  Snelling in his house at Bethnal \\nGreen, but unhappily he wa s not in a condition to reme mber anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too \\nmuch, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned, however, \\nfrom his wife, who seemed a decent, poor  soul, that he was only the assistant of \\nSmollet, who of the two mates was the re sponsible person. So off I drove to \\nWalworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, \\ntaking a late tea out of a saucer. He is  a decent, intelligen t fellow, distinctly a \\ngood, reliable type of workman, a nd with a headpiece of his own. He \\nremembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog-\\neared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hi eroglyphical entries in thick, half-\\nobliterated pencil, he gave me the dest inations of the boxes. There were, he \\nsaid, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197 Chicksand \\nStreet, Mile End New Town , and another six which he deposited at Jamaica \\nLane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of \\nhis over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean  to confine himself to two sides of \\nLondon. He was now fixed on the far east on the northern shore, on the east of \\nthe southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical sc heme, let alone the City itself and the \\nvery heart of fashionable London in th e south-west and west. I went back to \\nSmollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken \\nfrom Carfax.  \\nHe replied, \"Well guv\\'nor, you\\'ve treate d me very \\'an\\'some\", I had given \\nhim half a sovereign, \"an I\\'ll tell yer al l I know. I heard a man by the name of \\nBloxam say four nights ago in the \\'Are an \\' \\'Ounds, in Pincher\\'s Alley, as \\'ow he \\nan\\' his mate \\'ad \\'ad a rare dusty job in a old \\'ouse at Purfleet. There ain\\'t a many \\nsuch jobs as this \\'ere, an\\' I\\'m thin kin\\' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye \\nsummut.\"  \\nI asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get \\nme the address it would be worth anothe r half sovereign to him. So he gulped \\ndown the rest of his tea and stood up , saying that he was going to begin the \\nsearch then and there.  \\nAt the door he stopped, and said, \"Look \\'ere, guv\\'nor, there ain\\'t no sense \\nin me a keepin\\' you \\'ere. I may find Sam so on, or I mayn\\'t, but anyhow he ain\\'t \\nlike to be in a way to tell ye much tonigh t. Sam is a rare one when he starts on \\nthe booze. If you can give me a enve lope with a stamp on it, and put yer \\naddress on it, I\\'ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye tonight. But ye\\'d better be up arter \\'im soon in th e mornin\\', never mind the booze the night \\nafore.\"  \\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy \\nan envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, \\nI addressed the envelope and stamped it,  and when Smollet had again faithfully \\npromised to post the address when foun d, I took my way to home. We\\'re on the \\ntrack anyhow. I am tired tonight, and I want to sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale. Her eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, \\nI\\'ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly \\nanxious about me and the others. But it is  best as it is. It is better to be \\ndisappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. \\nThe doctors were quite rig ht to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful \\nbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances. Indeed, It may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the \\nsubject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of \\nour decision.  \\n2 October, evening--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post I \\ngot my directed envelope with a dirty sc rap of paper enclosed, on which was \\nwritten with a carpenter\\'s pencil in a sp rawling hand, \"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, \\n4 Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite.\"  \\nI got the letter in bed, and rose w ithout waking Mina. She looked heavy \\nand sleepy and pale, and far from well.  I determined not to wake her, but that \\nwhen I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back \\nto Exeter. I think she would be happier in  our own home, with her daily tasks to \\ninterest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. \\nSeward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back \\nand tell the rest so soon as I shou ld have found out anything. I drove to \\nWalworth and found, with some diffic ulty, Potter\\'s Court. Mr. Smollet\\'s \\nspelling misled me, as I asked for Pote r\\'s Court instead of Potter\\'s Court. \\nHowever, when I had found the court,  I had no difficulty in discovering \\nCorcoran\\'s lodging house.  \\nWhen I asked the man who came to the door for the \"depite,\" he shook his \\nhead, and said, \"I dunno \\'im. There ain\\'t no such a person \\'ere. I never \\'eard of \\n\\'im in all my bloomin\\' days. Don\\'t believe there ain\\'t nobody of that kind livin\\' \\n\\'ere or anywheres.\"  I took out Smollet\\'s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of \\nthe spelling of the name of the court might guide me. \"What are you?\" I asked.  \\n\"I\\'m the depity,\" he answered.  \\nI saw at once that I was on the right track. Phonetic sp elling had again \\nmisled me. A half crown tip put the depu ty\\'s knowledge at my disposal, and I \\nlearned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the \\nprevious night at Corcoran\\'s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o\\'clock that \\nmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had \\na vague idea that it was some kind of a \"new-fangled ware\\'us,\" and with this \\nslender clue I had to start for Poplar. It  was twelve o\\'clock before I got any \\nsatisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee shop, where some \\nworkmen were having their dinner. One of them suggested that there was being \\nerected at Cross Angel Street a new \"cold storage\" building, and as this suited \\nthe condition of a \"new-fangled ware\\'us, \" I at once drove to it. An interview \\nwith a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased \\nwith the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam. He was sent for on my suggestion that I was w illing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the \\nprivilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was a smart \\nenough fellow, though rough of speech an d bearing. When I had promised to \\npay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes, \"main heavy ones,\" with a horse and cart \\nhired by him for this purpose.  \\nI asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to \\nwhich he replied, \"Well, guv\\'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few \\ndoor from a big white church, or somethink  of the kind, not long built. It was a \\ndusty old \\'ouse, too, thou gh nothin\\' to the dustiness of the \\'ouse we tooked the \\nbloomin\\' boxes from.\"  \\n\"How did you get in if both houses were empty?\"  \\n\"There was the old party what engaged me a waitin\\' in the \\'ouse at Purfleet. \\nHe \\'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was \\nthe strongest chap I ever struck, an\\' him a old feller, with a white moustache, \\none that thin you would think he  couldn\\'t throw a shadder.\"  \\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!  \"Why, \\'e took up \\'is end o\\' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a \\npuffin\\' an\\' a blowin\\' afore I could upend mine anyhow, an\\' I\\'m no chicken, \\nneither.\"  \\n\"How did you get into  the house in Piccadilly?\" I asked.  \\n\"He was there too. He must \\'a starte d off and got there afore me, for when \\nI rung of the bell he kem an\\' opened the  door \\'isself an\\' \\'elped me carry the \\nboxes into the \\'all.\"  \\n\"The whole nine?\" I asked.  \\n\"Yus, there was five in the first load an\\' four in the second. It was main dry \\nwork, an\\' I don\\'t so well remember \\'ow I got \\'ome.\"  \\nI interrupted him, \"Were the boxes left in the hall?\"  \\n\"Yus, it was a big \\'all, an\\' there was nothin\\' else in it.\"  I made one more attempt to further matters. \"You didn\\'t have any key?\"  \\n\"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he  opened the door \\'isself \\nan\\' shut it again when I druv off. I don\\'t remember the last time, but that was \\nthe beer.\"  \\n\"And you can\\'t remember the number of the house?\"  \\n\"No, sir. But ye needn\\'t have no di fficulty about that. It\\'s a \\'igh \\'un with a \\nstone front with a bow on it, an\\' \\'igh step s up to the door. I know them steps, \\n\\'avin\\' \\'ad to carry the boxes up with th ree loafers what come round to earn a \\ncopper. The old gent give them shillin\\'s,  an\\' they seein\\' they got so much, they \\nwanted more. But \\'e took one of them by th e shoulder and was like to throw \\'im \\ndown the steps, till the lot of  them went away cussin\\'.\"  \\nI thought that with this description I could find the house, so having paid \\nmy friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new \\npainful experience. The Count could, it was evident, handle the earth boxes \\nhimself. If so, time was precious, for now that he had achieved a certain \\namount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task \\nunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I di scharged my cab, and walked westward. \\nBeyond the Junior Constitu tional I came across the house described and was \\nsatisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long un tenanted. The windows were encrusted \\nwith dust, and the shutters were up. A ll the framework wa s black with time, \\nand from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to \\nlately there had been a large notice board  in front of the balcony. It had, \\nhowever, been roughly torn away, the upri ghts which had supported it still \\nremaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, \\nwhose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been \\nable to see the notice board intact, as it  would, perhaps, have given some clue \\nto the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, a nd I could not but feel that if I could \\nfind the former owner there might be so me means discovered of gaining access \\nto the house.  \\nThere was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and \\nnothing could be done, so I went around to the back to see if anything could be \\ngathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being \\nmostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anyt hing about the empty house. One of them \\nsaid that he heard it had lately been ta ken, but he couldn\\'t say from whom. He \\ntold me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice board of \"For \\nSale\" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons , & Candy the house agents could tell \\nme something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or \\nguess too much, so thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was \\nnow growing dusk, and the au tumn night was closing in , so I did not lose any \\ntime. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory \\nat the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.  \\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but \\nuncommunicative in equal proportion. Ha ving once told me that the Piccadilly \\nhouse, which throughout our interview he  called a \"mansion,\" was sold, he \\nconsidered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he \\nopened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying, \"It \\nis sold, sir.\"  \\n\"Pardon me,\" I said, with eq ual politeness, \"but I have a special reason for \\nwishing to know w ho purchased it.\"  \\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \"It is sold, sir,\" \\nwas again his laconic reply.  \\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"you do not mind letting me know so much.\"  \"But I do mind,\" he answered. \"The affa irs of their clients are absolutely \\nsafe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\"  \\nThis was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing \\nwith him. I thought I had best meet him  on his own ground, so I said, \"Your \\nclients, sir, are happy in ha ving so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am \\nmyself a professional man.\"  \\nHere I handed him my card. \"In this instance I am not prompted by \\ncuriosity, I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes  to know something \\nof the property which was, he understood, lately for sale.\"  \\nThese words put a different complexion on affairs. He said, \"I would like \\nto oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his \\nlordship. We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the honourable Arthur Hol mwood. If you will let me have his \\nlordship\\'s address I will cons ult the House on the subject , and will, in any case, \\ncommunicate with his lordship by tonight\\'s post. It will be a pleasure if we can \\nso far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his \\nlordship.\"  \\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, \\ngave the address at Dr. Seward\\'s and came away. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and came \\ndown to Purfleet by the next train.  \\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she \\nmade a gallant effort to be bright and ch eerful. It wrung my heart to think that I \\nhad had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquiet ude. Thank God, \\nthis will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the \\nsting of our not show ing our confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the \\nwise resolution of keepi ng her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more \\nreconciled, or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for \\nwhen any accidental allusion is made sh e actually shudders. I am glad we made \\nour resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our  growing knowledge \\nwould be torture to her.  \\nI could not tell the others of the day\\'s discovery till we were alone, so after \\ndinner, followed by a little music to save  appearances even amongst ourselves, \\nI took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more \\naffectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me, but there was much to be talked of a nd I came away. Thank God, the ceasing of \\ntelling things has made no difference between us.  \\nWhen I came down again I found the o thers all gathered round the fire in \\nthe study. In the train I ha d written my diary so far, and simply read it off to \\nthem as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information.  \\nWhen I had finished Van Helsing said, \"This has been a great day\\'s work, \\nfriend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the tr ack of the missing boxes. If we find \\nthem all in that house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some \\nmissing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, \\nand hunt the wretch to his real death.\"  \\nWe all sat silent awhile and all at  once Mr. Morris spoke, \"Say! How are \\nwe going to get into that house?\"  \\n\"We got into the other,\" answered Lord Godalming quickly.  \\n\"But, Art, this is different. We broke  house at Carfax, but we had night and \\na walled park to protect us. It will  be a mighty differe nt thing to commit \\nburglary in Piccadilly, either  by day or night. I conf ess I don\\'t see how we are \\ngoing to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort.\"  \\nLord Godalming\\'s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the \\nroom. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us, \\n\"Quincey\\'s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious. We got off \\nonce all right, but we have now a rare job on hand. Unless we can find the \\nCount\\'s key basket.\"  \\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least \\nadvisable to wait till Lord Godalming shou ld hear from Mitchell\\'s, we decided \\nnot to take any active step before breakfa st time. For a good while we sat and \\nsmoked, discussing the matter in its va rious lights and bearings. I took the \\nopportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and \\nshall go to bed  \\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her forehead \\nis puckered up into little wrinkles, as th ough she thinks even in her sleep. She \\nis still too pale, but do es not look so haggard as she did this morning. \\nTomorrow will, I hope, mend all this. She will be herself at home in Exeter. Oh, \\nbut I am sleepy!   \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n1 October.--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so \\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean \\nsomething more than his own well-being,  they form a more than interesting \\nstudy. This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, \\nhis manner was that of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact, \\ncommanding destiny, subjectively. He did not really care for an y of the things \\nof mere earth, he was in the clouds an d looked down on all the weaknesses and \\nwants of us poor mortals.  \\nI thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked \\nhim, \"What about the flies these times?\"  \\nHe smiled on me in quite a superior so rt of way, such a smile as would \\nhave become the face of Malv olio, as he answered me, \"The fly, my dear sir, \\nhas one striking feature. It\\'s wings are typical of the aerial powers of the \\npsychic faculties. The ancients did we ll when they typified the soul as a \\nbutterfly!\"  \\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logica lly, so I said quickly, \\n\"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\"  \\nHis madness foiled his reason, and a pu zzled look spread over his face as, \\nshaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him.  \\nHe said, \"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\" Here he \\nbrightened up. \"I am pretty indifferent about  it at present. Life is all right. I \\nhave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study \\nzoophagy!\"  \\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on. \"Then you command life. You \\nare a god, I suppose?\"  \\nHe smiled with an ineffably benign superi ority. \"Oh no! Far be it from me \\nto arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His \\nespecially spiritual doings. If  I may state my intellectual  position I am, so far as \\nconcerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the po sition which Enoch \\noccupied spiritually!\"  This was a poser to me. I could no t at the moment recall Enoch\\'s \\nappositeness, so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I \\nwas lowering myself in the eyes of  the lunatic. \"And why with Enoch?\"  \\n\"Because he walked with God.\"  \\nI could not see the analogy,  but did not like to admit it, so I harked back to \\nwhat he had denied. \"So you don\\'t car e about life and you don\\'t want souls. \\nWhy not?\" I put my questi on quickly and somewhat st ernly, on purpose to \\ndisconcert him.  \\nThe effort succeeded, for an instant he  unconsciously relapsed into his old \\nservile manner, bent low before me, and ac tually fawned upon me  as he replied. \\n\"I don\\'t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don\\'t. I couldn\\'t use them if I had \\nthem. They would be no manner of use to me. I couldn\\'t eat them or\"  \\nHe suddenly stopped and the old cunnin g look spread over his face, like a \\nwind sweep on the surface of the water.  \\n\"And doctor, as to life, what is it afte r all? When you\\'ve got all you require, \\nand you know that you will ne ver want, that is all. I have friends, good friends, \\nlike you, Dr. Seward.\" This was said with  a leer of inexpressible cunning. \"I \\nknow that I shall never lack the means of life!\"  \\nI think that through the cl oudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism \\nin me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he, a dogged silence. \\nAfter a short time I saw that for the presen t it was useless to speak to him. He \\nwas sulky, and so I came away.  \\nLater in the day he sent for me. Ordina rily I would not have come without \\nspecial reason, but just at present I am  so interested in him  that I would gladly \\nmake an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything to help pass the time. \\nHarker is out, following up clues, and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey. \\nVan Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers. \\nHe seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light up on some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I \\nwould have taken him with me  to see the patient, only  I thought that after his \\nlast repulse he might not care to go ag ain. There was also another reason. \\nRenfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were \\nalone.  I found him sitting in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is \\ngenerally indicative of some mental energy  on his part. When I came in, he said \\nat once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips. \"What about \\nsouls?\"  \\nIt was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious \\ncerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic. I determined to have the \\nmatter out.  \\n\"What about them yourself?\" I asked.  \\nHe did not reply for a moment but looke d all around him, and up and down, \\nas though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.  \\n\"I don\\'t want any souls!\" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter \\nseemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it, to \"be cruel only to \\nbe kind.\" So I said, \"You like life, and you want life?\"  \\n\"Oh yes! But that is all right. You needn\\'t worry about that!\"  \\n\"But,\" I asked, \"how are we to get the life without getting the soul also?\"  \\nThis seemed to puzzle him, so I follow ed it up, \"A nice time you\\'ll have \\nsome time when you\\'re flying out here, with the souls of thousands of flies and \\nspiders and birds and cats buzzing and tw ittering and moaning all around you. \\nYou\\'ve got their lives, you know, and you must pu t up with their souls!\"  \\nSomething seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his \\nears and shut his eyes, scre wing them up tightly ju st as a small boy does when \\nhis face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me. It also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child, only a child, \\nthough the features were worn, and the s tubble on the jaws was white. It was \\nevident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and knowing how his past mood s had interpreted things  seemingly foreign to \\nhimself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with \\nhim.  \\nThe first step was to restore confiden ce, so I asked him, speaking pretty \\nloud so that he would hear me throug h his closed ears, \"Would you like some \\nsugar to get your flies around again?\"  He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he \\nreplied, \"Not much! Flies are poor things , after all!\" After a pause he added, \\n\"But I don\\'t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\"  \\n\"Or spiders?\" I went on.  \\n\"Blow spiders! What\\'s the use of spiders? There isn\\'t anything in them to \\neat or\" He stopped suddenly as th ough reminded of a forbidden topic.  \\n\"So, so!\" I thought to myself, \"this is the second time he has suddenly \\nstopped at the word \\'drink\\'. What does it mean?\"  \\nRenfield seemed himself aware of havi ng made a lapse, for he hurried on, \\nas though to distract my attention from it,  \"I don\\'t take any stock at all in such \\nmatters. \\'Rats and mice and such small deer,\\' as Shakespeare has it, \\'chicken \\nfeed of the larder\\' they might be called. I\\'m past all that sort of nonsense. You \\nmight as well ask a man to eat molecules w ith a pair of chopsticks, as to try to \\ninterest me about the less carnivora, when I know of what is before me.\"  \\n\"I see,\" I said. \"You want big things that you can ma ke your teeth meet in? \\nHow would you like to breakfast on an elephant?\"  \\n\"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking?\" He was getting too wide \\nawake, so I thought I w ould press him hard.  \\n\"I wonder,\" I said reflectively, \"wha t an elephant\\'s soul is like!\"  \\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse \\nand became a child again.  \\n\"I don\\'t want an elephant\\'s soul, or an y soul at all!\" he said. For a few \\nmoments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes \\nblazing and all the signs of intense cer ebral excitement. \"To hell with you and \\nyour souls!\" he shouted. \"Why do you plague me ab out souls? Haven\\'t I got \\nenough to worry, and pain, to  distract me already, without thinking of souls?\"  \\nHe looked so hostile that I thought he was in for an other homicidal fit, so I \\nblew my whistle.  \\nThe instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically, \\n\"Forgive me, Doctor. I forgot myself . You do not need any help. I am so \\nworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and \\npardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot \\nthink freely when my body is confined.  I am sure you will understand!\"  \\nHe had evidently self-control, so wh en the attendants came I told them not \\nto mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go. When the door was \\nclosed he said with considerable dignity  and sweetness, \"Dr. Seward, you have \\nbeen very considerate towards me. Believe  me that I am very, very grateful to \\nyou!\"  \\nI thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away. There is \\ncertainly something to ponder over in this man\\'s state. Several points seem to \\nmake what the American interviewer calls \"a story,\" if one could only get them \\nin proper order. Here they are:  \\nWill not mention \"drinking.\" \\nFears the thought of being burdened with the \"soul\" of anything. Has no dread of wanting \"life\" in the future. \\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads \\nbeing haunted by their souls. \\nLogically all these th ings point one way! He has assurance of \\nsome kind that he will acquire some higher life. \\nHe dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul. Then it is a \\nhuman life he looks to! \\nAnd the assurance? Merciful God! The Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme \\nof terror afoot!   \\nLater.--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion. \\nHe grew very grave, and after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to \\ntake him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we heard the lunatic \\nwithin singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago.  When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar \\nas of old. The flies, lethargic with the  autumn, were beginning to buzz into the \\nroom. We tried to make him talk of the  subject of our prev ious conversation, \\nbut he would not attend. He went on with hi s singing, just as  though we had not \\nbeen present. He had got a scrap of pa per and was folding it into a notebook. \\nWe had to come away as ignorant as we went in.  \\nHis is a curious case indeed. We must watch him tonight.  \\nLETTER, MITCHELL, SONS & CA NDY TO LORD GODALMING.  \\n\"1 October.  \\n\"My Lord,  \\n\"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with \\nregard to the desire of your Lordship, e xpressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, \\nto supply the following infor mation concerning the sale  and purchase of No. \\n347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. \\nArchibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser  is a foreign nobleman, Count de \\nVille, who effected the purchase himse lf paying the purchase money in notes \\n\\'over the counter,\\' if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an \\nexpression. Beyond this we k now nothing whatever of him.  \\n\"We are, my Lord,  \\n\"Your Lordship\\'s humble servants,  \"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n2 October.--I placed a man in the corridor  last night, a nd told him to make \\nan accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield\\'s room, and gave \\nhim instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study, Mrs. Harker \\nhaving gone to bed, we discussed the a ttempts and discoveries of the day. \\nHarker was the only one who had any res ult, and we are in great hopes that his \\nclue may be an important one.  \\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient\\'s room and looked in \\nthrough the observation trap. He was sleepin g soundly, his heart rose and fell \\nwith regular respiration.  \\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he \\nwas restless and kept saying his prayer s somewhat loudly. I asked him if that \\nwas all. He replied that it was all he  heard. There was something about his \\nmanner, so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \"dozed \" for a while. It is too bad that men \\ncannot be trusted unless they are watched.  \\nToday Harker is out following up hi s clue, and Art and Quincey are \\nlooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses \\nalways in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will \\nbe no time to lose. We must sterilize all the imported earth between sunrise and \\nsunset. We shall thus catch the Count at  his weakest, and without a refuge to \\nfly to. Van Helsing is off to the British  Museum looking up so me authorities on \\nancient medicine. The old physicians took account of things which their \\nfollowers do not accept, and the Profes sor is searching for witch and demon \\ncures which may be useful to us later.  \\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in \\nstrait waistcoats.  \\nLater.--We have met again. We seem at  last to be on the track, and our \\nwork of tomorrow may be the beginning of  the end. I wonder if Renfield\\'s quiet \\nhas anything to do with this. His moods have so follow ed the doings of the \\nCount, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him some \\nsubtle way. If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind, \\nbetween the time of my argument with  him today and his resumption of fly-\\ncatching, it might afford us a valuable  clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a \\nspell Is he? That wild yell seemed to come from his room  \\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had \\nsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell, and when he went to \\nhim found him lying on his face on the floor , all covered with blood. I must go \\nat once   \\nCHAPTER 21  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n3 October.\\n--Let me put down with exactne ss all that happened, as well as I \\ncan remember, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten. In all calmness I must proceed.  \\nWhen I came to Renfield\\'s room I f ound him lying on the floor on his left \\nside in a glittering pool of  blood. When I went to move him, it became at once \\napparent that he had received some terrible  injuries. There seemed none of the \\nunity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic \\nsanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as \\nthough it had been beaten against the f loor. Indeed it was from the face wounds \\nthat the pool of blood originated.  \\nThe attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned \\nhim over, \"I think, sir, his  back is broken. See, bot h his right arm and leg and \\nthe whole side of his face are para lysed.\" How such a thing could have \\nhappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewildered, \\nand his brows were gathered in as he said, \"I can\\'t understand the two things. \\nHe could mark his face like that by b eating his own head on the floor. I saw a \\nyoung woman do it once at the Eversfie ld Asylum before anyone could lay \\nhands on her. And I suppose he might have broken his neck by falling out of \\nbed, if he got in an awkward kink. Bu t for the life of me I can\\'t imagine how \\nthe two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn\\'t beat his head, and if \\nhis face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.\"  \\nI said to him, \"Go to Dr. Van Helsing,  and ask him to kindly come here at \\nonce. I want him without an instant\\'s delay.\"  \\nThe man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing \\ngown and slippers, appeared. When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turn ed to me. I think he recognized my \\nthought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the \\nattendant, \"Ah, a sad accide nt! He will need very careful watching, and much \\nattention. I shall st ay with you myself, but  I shall first dress myself. If you will \\nremain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"  The patient was now breathing stertoro usly and it was easy to see that he \\nhad suffered some terrible injury.  \\nVan Helsing returned with extraord inary celerity, bearing with him a \\nsurgical case. He had evidently been th inking and had his mind made up, for \\nalmost before he looked at the patient,  he whispered to me, \"Send the attendant \\naway. We must be alone with him wh en he becomes conscious, after the \\noperation.\"  \\nI said, \"I think that will do now, Simmons . We have done all that we can at \\npresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let \\nme know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"  \\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. \\nThe wounds of the face we re superficial. The real  injury was a depressed \\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area.  \\nThe Professor thought a moment and sa id, \"We must reduce the pressure \\nand get back to normal conditions, as far as can  be. The rapidity of the \\nsuffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole motor area seems \\naffected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine \\nat once or it may be too late.\"  \\nAs he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I went over and \\nopened it and found in the corridor wi thout, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas \\nand slippers; the former spoke, \"I hear d your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and \\ntell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for \\nany of us these times. I\\'ve been thin king that tomorrow night will not see things \\nas they have been. We\\'ll have to look back, and forward a little more than we \\nhave done. May we come in?\"  \\nI nodded, and held the door open till  they had entered, then I closed it \\nagain. When Quincey saw th e attitude and state of th e patient, and noted the \\nhorrible pool on the floor, he said softly,  \"My God! What has happened to him? \\nPoor, poor devil!\"  \\nI told him briefly, and added that  we expected he would recover \\nconsciousness after the operation, for a short time, at all events. He went at \\nonce and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him. We all \\nwatched in patience.  \"We shall wait,\" said Van Helsing, \"jus t long enough to fix the best spot \\nfor trephining, so that we may most  quickly and perfectly remove the blood \\nclot, for it is evident that th e haemorrhage is increasing.\"  \\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a \\nhorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing\\'s face I gathered that he felt \\nsome fear or apprehension as to wh at was to come. I dreaded the words \\nRenfield might speak. I was positively af raid to think. But the conviction of \\nwhat was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death \\nwatch. The poor man\\'s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes  and speak, but then would follow a \\nprolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed \\ninsensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew and \\ngrew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart, and the blood \\nsurging through my temples sounded l ike blows from a hammer. The silence \\nfinally became agonizing. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal \\ntorture. There was a nervous suspense ov er us all, as though overhead some \\ndread bell would peal out powerfully wh en we should least expect it.  \\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the pa tient was sinking \\nfast. He might die at any moment. I lo oked up at the Professor and caught his \\neyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke, \"There is no time to \\nlose. His words may be worth many lives. I have been thinking so, as I stood \\nhere. It may be there is a soul at stake!  We shall operate just above the ear.\"  \\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the \\nbreathing continued to be stertorous. Th en there came a breath so prolonged \\nthat it seemed as though it would tear open  his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, \\nand became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few \\nmoments, then it was softened into a glad surprise, and from his lips came a \\nsigh of relief. He moved convulsively, a nd as he did so, said, \"I\\'ll be quiet, \\nDoctor. Tell them to take off the strait waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What\\'s wrong with my face? It \\nfeels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully.\"  \\nHe tried to turn his head, but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow \\nglassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave \\ntone, \"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\"  As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he \\nsaid, \"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some \\nwater, my lips are dry, and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\"  \\nHe stopped and seemed fainting. I ca lled quietly to Quincey, \"The brandy, \\nit is in my study, quick!\" He flew and returned with a glas s, the decanter of \\nbrandy and a carafe of water. We moiste ned the parched lips, and the patient \\nquickly revived.  \\nIt seemed, however, that his poor inju red brain had been working in the \\ninterval, for when he was qui te conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an \\nagonized confusion which I shall never forget, and said, \"I must not deceive \\nmyself. It was no dream, but all a grim reality.\" Then his eyes roved round the room. As they caught sight of the two fi gures sitting patiently on the edge of \\nthe bed he went on, \"If I were not sure already, I would know from them.\"  \\nFor an instant his eyes cl osed, not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as \\nthough he were bringing all his faculties to bear. When he opened them he said, \\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he  had yet displayed, \"Quick, Doctor, \\nquick, I am dying! I feel tha t I have but a few minutes, and then I must go back \\nto death, or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something that I must say before I die. Or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank \\nyou! It was that night after you left me , when I implored you to let me go away. \\nI couldn\\'t speak then, for I felt my tongue  was tied. But I was as sane then, \\nexcept in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me, it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realized where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\"  \\nAs he spoke, Van Helsing\\'s eyes ne ver blinked, but his hand came out and \\nmet mine and gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself. He nodded \\nslightly and said, \"Go on,\" in a low voice.  \\nRenfield proceeded. \"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen \\nhim often before, but he was solid then, n ot a ghost, and his eyes were fierce \\nlike a man\\'s when angry. He was laughi ng with his red mouth,  the sharp white \\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned  to look back over the belt of trees, \\nto where the dogs were bark ing. I wouldn\\'t ask him to co me in at first, though I \\nknew he wanted to, just as he had wante d all along. Then he began promising \\nme things, not in words but by doing them.\"  \\nHe was interrupted by a word from the Professor, \"How?\"  \"By making them happen. Just as he used  to send in the flies when the sun \\nwas shining. Great big fat ones with stee l and sapphire on their wings. And big \\nmoths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones  on their backs.\"  \\nVan Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously, \"The \\nAcherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, wh at you call the \\'Death\\'s-head Moth\\'?\"  \\nThe patient went on withou t stopping, \"Then he be gan to whisper. \\'Rats, \\nrats, rats! Hundreds, thous ands, millions of them, and every one a life. And \\ndogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! All red blood, with y ears of life in it, \\nand not merely buzzing flies!\\' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he \\ncould do. Then the dogs how led, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He \\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, \\nand seemed to call out with out using any words. A dark  mass spread over the \\ngrass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire. An d then He moved the mist \\nto the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their \\neyes blazing red, like His only smalle r. He held up his hand, and they all \\nstopped, and I thought he seemed to be saying, \\'All these live s will I give you, \\nay, and many more and greater, through  countless ages, if  you will fall down \\nand worship me!\\' And then a red cloud, l ike the colour of blood, seemed to \\nclose over my eyes, and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself \\nopening the sash and saying to Him, \\'Come in, Lord and Master!\\' The rats were \\nall gone, but He slid into the room thr ough the sash, though it was only open an \\ninch wide, just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack \\nand has stood before me in all her size and splendour.\"  \\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and \\nhe continued, but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the \\ninterval for his story was further advan ced. I was about to call him back to the \\npoint, but Van Helsing whispered to me, \"L et him go on. Do not interrupt him. \\nHe cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the \\nthread of his thought.\"  \\nHe proceeded, \"All day I waited to h ear from him, but he did not send me \\nanything, not even a blowfly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he did slide in through the window, though it was shut, and did \\nnot even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face \\nlooked out of the mist with his red eyes  gleaming, and he went on as though he \\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn\\'t even smell the same as he went by me. I couldn\\'t hold him. I tho ught that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had \\ncome into the room.\"  The two men sitting on the  bed stood up and came over, standing behind \\nhim so that he could not see them, but wher e they could hear better. They were \\nboth silent, but the Professor started a nd quivered. His face, however, grew \\ngrimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing, \"When Mrs. \\nHarker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\\'t the same. It was like tea \\nafter the teapot has been watered.\" Here  we all moved, but no one said a word.  \\nHe went on, \"I didn\\'t know that she was here till she spoke, and she didn\\'t \\nlook the same. I don\\'t care for the pale peo ple. I like them with lots of blood in \\nthem, and hers all seemed to have run out. I didn\\'t think of it at the time, but \\nwhen she went away I bega n to think, and it made me mad to know that He had \\nbeen taking the life out of her.\" I could f eel that the rest quivered, as I did; but \\nwe remained otherwise still. \"So when  He came tonight I was ready for Him. I \\nsaw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have \\nunnatural strength. And as I knew I was a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to \\nstruggle with me. I held tight, and I thought I was going to win, for I didn\\'t \\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, \\nand my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and when I tried to \\ncling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud \\nbefore me, and a noise like thunder, a nd the mist seemed to steal away under \\nthe door.\"  \\nHis voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous. Van \\nHelsing stood up instinctively.  \\n\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose. \\nIt may not be too late. Let us be armed,  the same as we were the other night, \\nbut lose no time, there is no t an instant to spare.\"  \\nThere was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words, we \\nshared them in common. We all hurried  and took from our rooms the same \\nthings that we had when we entered the Count\\'s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he  pointed to them significantly as he said, \\n\"They never leave me, and they shall not t ill this unhappy business is over. Be \\nwise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with Alas! Alas! \\nThat dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped, his voice was breaking, \\nand I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.  \\nOutside the Harkers\\' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the \\nlatter said, \"Should we disturb her?\"  \"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall break \\nit in.\"  \\n\"May it not frighten her terribly? It is  unusual to break into a lady\\'s room!\"  \\nVan Helsing said solemnly, \"You are al ways right. But this is life and \\ndeath. All chambers are alike to the do ctor. And even were they not they are all \\nas one to me tonight. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not \\nopen, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends. \\nNow!\"  \\nHe turned the handle as he spoke,  but the door did not yield. We threw \\nourselves against it. With a crash it burs t open, and we almost fell headlong \\ninto the room. The Professor did actuall y fall, and I saw across him as he \\ngathered himself up from hands and kn ees. What I saw appalled me. I felt my \\nhair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still.  \\nThe moonlight was so bright that thro ugh the thick yellow blind the room \\nwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, \\nhis face flushed and breathi ng heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the \\nnear edge of the bed facing outwards wa s the white-clad figure of his wife. By \\nher side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but \\nthe instant we saw we all recognized the Count, in every way, even to the scar \\non his forehead. With his left hand he he ld both Mrs. Harker\\'s hands, keeping \\nthem away with her arms at full tension. His right hand  gripped her by the back \\nof the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white  nightdress was \\nsmeared with blood, and a thin stream  trickled down the man\\'s bare chest \\nwhich was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible \\nresemblance to a child forcing a kitten\\'s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it \\nto drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his f ace, and the hellish \\nlook that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with \\ndevilish passion. The great nostrils of the  white aquiline nose opened wide and \\nquivered at the edge, and the white sharp te eth, behind the full lips of the blood \\ndripping mouth, clamped together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, \\nwhich threw his victim back upon the be d as though hurled from a height, he \\nturned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and \\nwas holding towards him the envelope wh ich contained the Sacred Wafer. The \\nCount suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight sudd enly failed, as a great black cloud \\nsailed across the sky. And when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey\\'s match, \\nwe saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as  we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its  bursting open, had swung back to its old position. \\nVan Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had \\ndrawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so \\ndespairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. \\nFor a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude an d disarray. Her face was \\nghastly, with a pallor which was accentu ated by the blood which smeared her \\nlips and cheeks and chin. From her throa t trickled a thin stream of blood. Her \\neyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, \\nwhich bore on their whiteness the red mark  of the Count\\'s terrible grip, and \\nfrom behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream \\nseem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped \\nforward and drew the coverl et gently over her body, whil st Art, after looking at \\nher face for an instant despairi ngly, ran out of the room.  \\nVan Helsing whispered to me, \"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know \\nthe Vampire can produce. We can do no thing with poor Madam Mina for a few \\nmoments till she recovers herself. I must wake him!\"  \\nHe dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him \\non the face, his wife all the while ho lding her face betw een her hands and \\nsobbing in a way that was heart breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked \\nout of the window. There was much moons hine, and as I looked I could see \\nQuincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great \\nyew tree. It puzzled me to think why he  was doing this. But at the instant I \\nheard Harker\\'s quick exclamation as he  woke to partial consciousness, and \\nturned to the bed. On his face, as the re might well be, was a look of wild \\namazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness \\nseemed to burst upon him all at  once, and he started up.  \\nHis wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her \\narms stretched out, as though to embrace him. Instantly, however, she drew \\nthem in again, and putting her elbows toge ther, held her hands before her face, \\nand shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.  \\n\"In God\\'s name what does this mean?\"  Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr. \\nVan Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear what \\nis it? What does that blood mean? My G od, my God! Has it come to this!\" And, \\nraising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly  together. \"Good God help \\nus! Help her! Oh, help her!\"  \\nWith a quick movement he jumped from  bed, and began to pull on his \\nclothes, all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened? Tell me all about it!\" he crie d without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, \\nyou love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too \\nfar yet. Guard her while I look for him!\"  \\nHis wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger \\nto him. Instantly forgetting her own grief,  she seized hold of him and cried out.  \\n\"No! No! Jonathan, you must not leav e me. I have suffered enough tonight, \\nGod knows, without the dread of his harming you.  You must stay with me. \\nStay with these friends who will watc h over you!\" Her expression became \\nfrantic as she spoke. And, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the \\nbedside, and clung to him fiercely.  \\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his \\ngolden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness, \"Do not fear, my dear. We \\nare here, and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for tonight, and we must be calm and take counsel together.\"  \\nShe shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband\\'s \\nbreast. When she raised it, his white nightrobe was stained with blood where \\nher lips had touched, and where the thin  open wound in the neck had sent forth \\ndrops. The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs.  \\n\"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it \\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have \\nmost cause to fear.\"  \\nTo this he spoke out reso lutely, \"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to \\nhear such a word. I would not hear it of  you. And I shall not hear it from you. \\nMay God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering \\nthan even this hour, if by any act or w ill of mine anything ever come between \\nus!\"  \\nHe put out his arms and folded her to  his breast. And for a while she lay \\nthere sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked \\ndamply above his quivering nostrils . His mouth was set as steel.  \\nAfter a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he \\nsaid to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous \\npower to the utmost.  \"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all abou t it. Too well I know the broad fact. \\nTell me all that has been.\"  \\nI told him exactly what had happened  and he listened with seeming \\nimpassiveness, but his nostr ils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the \\nruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, \\nwith her mouth to the open wound in his br east. It interested me, even at that \\nmoment, to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively \\nover the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. \\nJust as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door. They \\nentered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to \\ndivert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each \\nother and from themselves. So on nodd ing acquiescence to him he asked them \\nwhat they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming answered.  \\n\"I could not see him anywhere in the pa ssage, or in any of our rooms. I \\nlooked in the study but, th ough he had been there, he had gone. He had, \\nhowever\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the \\nbed.  \\nVan Helsing said gravely, \"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more \\nconcealments. Our hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!\"  \\nSo Art went on, \"He had been there, and though it could only have been \\nfor a few seconds, he made rare hay of  the place. All the manuscript had been \\nburned, and the blue flames were f lickering amongst the white ashes. The \\ncylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had \\nhelped the flames.\"  \\nHere I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!\"  \\nHis face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on. \"I ran downstairs \\nthen, but could see no sign of him. I looked into Renfield\\'s room, but there was \\nno trace there except\" Again he paused.  \\n\"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely. So he  bowed his head and moistening his \\nlips with his tongue, added, \"except that the poor fellow is dead.\"  \\nMrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said \\nsolemnly, \"God\\'s will be done!\"  I could not but feel that Art was keep ing back something. But, as I took it \\nthat it was with a purpos e, I said nothing.  \\nVan Helsing turned to Morris and as ked, \"And you, friend Quincey, have \\nyou any to tell?\"  \\n\"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I can\\'t \\nsay. I thought it well to know  if possible where the Count would go when he \\nleft the house. I did not s ee him, but I saw a bat rise from Renfield\\'s window, \\nand flap westward. I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax, but \\nhe evidently sought some other lair. He wi ll not be back tonigh t, for the sky is \\nreddening in the east, and the dawn is  close. We must work tomorrow!\"  \\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps a \\ncouple of minutes there was silence, an d I could fancy that I could hear the \\nsound of our hearts beating.  \\nThen Van Helsing said, placing his ha nd tenderly on Mrs. Harker\\'s head, \\n\"And now, Madam Mina, poor dear, dear, Madam Mina, tell us exactly what \\nhappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained, but it is need that \\nwe know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, \\nand in deadly earnest. The day is close to us  that must end all, if it may be so, \\nand now is the chance that we may live and learn.\"  \\nThe poor dear lady shivered, and I co uld see the tension of her nerves as \\nshe clasped her husband closer to her an d bent her head lower and lower still \\non his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held ou t one hand to Van \\nHelsing who took it in his, and after s tooping and kissing it reverently, held it \\nfast. The other hand was locked in that of  her husband, who held his other arm \\nthrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently \\nordering her thoughts, she began.  \\n\"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a \\nlong time it did not act. I seemed to be come more wakeful, and myriads of \\nhorrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind. All of them connected with \\ndeath, and vampires, with blood, a nd pain, and trouble.\" Her husband \\ninvoluntarily groaned as she turned to hi m and said lovingly, \"Do not fret, dear. \\nYou must be brave and strong, and he lp me through the horrible task. If you \\nonly knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thi ng at all, you would \\nunderstand how much I need your help . Well, I saw I must try to help the \\nmedicine to its work with my will, if it wa s to do me any good, so I resolutely \\nset myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my \\nside when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist \\nthat I had before noticed. But I forget  now if you know of this. You will find it \\nin my diary which I shall sh ow you later. I felt the sa me vague terror which had \\ncome to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake \\nJonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who \\nhad taken the sleeping drau ght, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. \\nThis caused me a great fear, and I lo oked around terrified . Then indeed, my \\nheart sank within me. Beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist, or \\nrather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, \\nstood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of \\nthe others. The waxen face, the high aqui line nose, on which the light fell in a \\nthin white line, the parted  red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between, \\nand the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. \\nMary\\'s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood stil l, and I would have \\nscreamed out, only that I was paralyzed. In  the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, \\ncutting whisper, pointing as  he spoke to Jonathan.  \\n\"\\'Silence! If you make a sound I sha ll take him and dash his brains out \\nbefore your very eyes.\\' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, \\'First, a \\nlittle refreshment to reward my exertions.  You may as well be  quiet. It is not \\nthe first time, or the second, that your  veins have appeased my thirst!\\' I was \\nbewildered, and strangely enough, I did no t want to hinder him. I suppose it is a \\npart of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, \\nmy God, my God, pity me! He placed his  reeking lips upon my throat!\" Her \\nhusband groaned again. She clasped his  hand harder, and looked at him \\npityingly, as if he were the  injured one, and went on.  \\n\"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long this \\nhorrible thing lasted I kn ow not, but it seemed that a long time must have \\npassed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the fresh blood!\" The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down b ut for her husband\\'s sustaining arm. \\nWith a great effort she recovered herself and went on.  \\n\"Then he spoke to me mockingly, \\'And so you, like the others, would play \\nyour brains against mine. You would he lp these men to hunt me and frustrate \\nme in my design! You know now, and the y know in part al ready, and will \\nknow in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to home.  Whilst they played wits against me, \\nagainst me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for \\nthem, hundreds of years before they we re born, I was countermining them. And \\nyou, their best beloved one, are now to  me, flesh of my flesh, blood of my \\nblood, kin of my kin, my bountiful wine-press for a while, and shall be later on \\nmy companion and my helper. You shall be avenged in turn, for not one of \\nthem but shall minister to your needs. Bu t as yet you are to be punished for \\nwhat you have done. You have aided in  thwarting me. Now you shall come to \\nmy call. When my brain says \"Come!\" to you, you shall cros s land or sea to do \\nmy bidding. And to that end this!\\'  \\n\"With that he pulled open hi s shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a \\nvein in his breast. When the blood began to spurt out,  he took my hands in one \\nof his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my \\nmouth to the wound, so that I must eithe r suffocate or swallow some to the \\nOh, my God! My God! What have I don e? What have I done to deserve such a \\nfate, I who have tried to walk in meekne ss and righteousness all my days. God \\npity me! Look down on a poor soul in wor se than mortal peril. And in mercy \\npity those to whom she is dear!\" Then sh e began to rub her lips as though to \\ncleanse them from pollution.  \\nAs she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and \\neverything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet; but over \\nhis face, as the awful narrative went on,  came a grey look which deepened and \\ndeepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn \\nshot up, the flesh stood darkly  out against the whitening hair.  \\nWe have arranged that one of us is  to stay within call of the unhappy pair \\ntill we can meet together and arrange about taking action.  \\nOf this I am sure. The sun rises today on no more miserable house in all \\nthe great round of its daily course.  \\nCHAPTER 22  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n3 October.\\n--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It is now \\nsix o\\'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat, for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward  are agreed that if we do not eat we \\ncannot work our best. Our best will be, G od knows, required to day. I must keep \\nwriting at every chance, for I dare not stop  to think. All, big and little, must go \\ndown. Perhaps at the end th e little things may teach us most. The teaching, big \\nor little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are today. \\nHowever, we must trust and hope. Poor  Mina told me just now, with the tears \\nrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is \\ntested. That we must keep on trusting, and that God will aid us up to the end. \\nThe end! Oh my God! What end? To work! To work!  \\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor \\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us \\nthat when he and Dr. Van Helsing had go ne down to the room below they had \\nfound Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and \\ncrushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.  \\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had \\nheard anything. He said that he had b een sitting down, he confessed to half \\ndozing, when he heard lo ud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called \\nout loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" After tha t there was a sound of \\nfalling, and when he entered the room  he found him lying on the floor, face \\ndown, just as the doctor s had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard \\n\"voices\" or \"a voice,\" and he said he could not say. That at first it had seemed \\nto him as if there were two, but as ther e was no one in the room it could have \\nbeen only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word \"God\" was \\nspoken by the patient.  \\nDr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into \\nthe matter. The question of an inquest ha d to be considered, and it would never \\ndo to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought \\nthat on the attendant\\'s evidence he could give a certificate of death by \\nmisadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there \\nwould be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result.  \\nWhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next \\nstep, the very first thing we decided wa s that Mina should be in full confidence. \\nThat nothing of any sort, no matter how painful, should be kept from her. She \\nherself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so \\nsorrowful, and in such a depth of despair.  \\n\"There must be no concealment,\" she said. \"Alas! We have had too much \\nalready. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured, than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it \\nmust be of new hope or of new courage to me!\"  \\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixed ly as she spoke, and said, suddenly \\nbut quietly, \"But dear Madam Mina, ar e you not afraid. Not for yourself, but \\nfor others from yourself, after what has happened?\"  \\nHer face grew set in its li nes, but her eyes shone with the de votion of a \\nmartyr as she answered, \"Ah no! For my mind is made up!\"  \\n\"To what?\" he asked gently, whilst we  were all very st ill, for each in our \\nown way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant.  \\nHer answer came with direct simplicity,  as though she was simply stating a \\nfact, \"Because if I find in myself, and I sh all watch keenly for it, a sign of harm \\nto any that I love, I shall die!\"  \\n\"You would not kill yourself?\" he asked, hoarsely.  \\n\"I would. If there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such \\na pain, and so desperate an effort!\" She looked at him meaningly as she spoke.  \\nHe was sitting down, but now he rose  and came close to her and put his \\nhand on her head as he said solemnly. \"My child, there is such an one if it were \\nfor your good. For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such \\nan euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! \\nBut my child\"  \\nFor a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat. He \\ngulped it down and went on, \"There are here some who would stand between \\nyou and death. You must n ot die. You must not die by any hand, but least of all \\nyour own. Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you \\nmust not die. For if he is still with the quick Undead, your death would make \\nyou even as he is. No, you must live! Y ou must struggle and strive to live, \\nthough death would seem a boon unspeaka ble. You must fight Death himself, \\nthough he come to you in pain or in joy. By  the day, or the ni ght, in safety or in \\nperil! On your living soul I charge you that you do not die.  Nay, nor think of \\ndeath, till this grea t evil be past.\"  \\nThe poor dear grew white as death, a nd shook and shivered, as I have seen \\na quicksand shake and shiver at the incom ing of the tide. We were all silent. \\nWe could do nothing. At length she gr ew more calm and turning to him said sweetly, but oh so sorrowfully, as she he ld out her hand, \"I promise you, my \\ndear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so. Till, if it may be \\nin His good time, this horror may have passed away from me.\"  \\nShe was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were \\nstrengthened to work and endure for he r, and we began to discuss what we \\nwere to do. I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the \\npapers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use, and was to keep the \\nrecord as she had done before. She was pleased with the prospect of anything \\nto do, if \"pleased\" could be used in conn ection with so grim an interest.  \\nAs usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was \\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.  \\n\"It is perhaps well,\" he said, \"that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax \\nwe decided not to do anything with the earth  boxes that lay there. Had we done \\nso, the Count must have gu essed our purpose, and w ould doubtless have taken \\nmeasures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others. But \\nnow he does not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilize his lairs, so that he cannot \\nuse them as of old.  \\n\"We are now so much further adva nced in our knowledge as to their \\ndisposition that, when we  have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track \\nthe very last of them. Today then, is ours, and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets tonight, \\nthat monster must retain whatever form he  now has. He is confined within the \\nlimitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear \\nthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he must open \\nthe door like a mortal. And so we have  this day to hunt o ut all his lairs and \\nsterilize them. So we shall, if we have  not yet catch him and destroy him, drive \\nhim to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in \\ntime, sure.\"  \\nHere I started up for I could not conta in myself at the thought that the \\nminutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina\\'s life and happiness were \\nflying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing \\nheld up his hand warningly.  \\n\"Nay, friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this, the quickest way home is the \\nlongest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with desperate quick, \\nwhen the time has come. But think, in a ll probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly. The Count ma y have many houses which he has \\nbought. Of them he will have  deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will \\nhave paper that he write on. He will have  his book of cheques. There are many \\nbelongings that he must have somewhere.  Why not in this place so central, so \\nquiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hours, when in the \\nvery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go th ere and search that \\nhouse. And when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur \\ncall, in his phrases of hunt \\'stop the earths\\'  and so we run down our old fox, so? \\nIs it not?\"  \\n\"Then let us come at once,\" I cried,  \"we are wasting the precious, precious \\ntime!\"  \\nThe Professor did not move, but sim ply said, \"And how are we to get into \\nthat house in Piccadilly?\"  \\n\"Any way!\" I cried. \"We shall break in if need be.\"  \\n\"And your police? Where will they  be, and what will they say?\"  \\nI was staggered, but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason \\nfor it. So I said, as quietly as I could,  \"Don\\'t wait more than need be. You know, \\nI am sure, what torture I am in.\"  \\n\"Ah, my child, that I do. And indeed there is no wish of me to add to your \\nanguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement. \\nThen will come our time. I have thoug ht and thought, and it seems to me that \\nthe simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get into the house, but we \\nhave no key. Is it not so?\" I nodded.  \\n\"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could \\nnot still get in. And thin k there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, \\nwhat would you do?\"  \\n\"I should get a respectable locksmith, an d set him to work to pick the lock \\nfor me.\"  \\n\"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?\"  \\n\"Oh no! Not if they knew the man was properly employed.\"  \"Then,\" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \"all that is in doubt is the \\nconscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or \\nnot that employer has a good conscience or  a bad one. Your police must indeed \\nbe zealous men and clever, oh so clever, in  reading the heart, that they trouble \\nthemselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off \\na hundred empty houses in this your London, or of any city in the world, and if \\nyou do it as such things ar e rightly done, and at the ti me such things are rightly \\ndone, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and \\nlock up his house, some burglar come a nd broke window at  back and got in. \\nThen he went and made open the shutte rs in front and walk out and in through \\nthe door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice. And when the day come he sell \\noff by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then \\nhe go to a builder, and he sell him that h ouse, making an agreement that he pull \\nit down and take all away within a certain time. A nd your police and other \\nauthority help him all they can. And wh en that owner come back from his \\nholiday in Switzerland he find only an  empty hole where his house had been. \\nThis was all done en regle, and in our work  we shall be en regle too. We shall \\nnot go so early that the policemen who have  then little to think of, shall deem it \\nstrange. But we shall go after ten o\\'clock,  when there are many about, and such \\nthings would be done were we indeed owners of the house.\"  \\nI could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina\\'s face \\nbecame relaxed in thought. There was hope in such good counsel.  \\nVan Helsing went on, \"When once with in that house we may find more \\nclues. At any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other \\nplaces where there be more earth boxe s, at Bermondsey and Mile End.\"  \\nLord Godalming stood up. \"I can be of some use here,\" he said. \"I shall \\nwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient.\"  \\n\"Look here, old fellow,\" said Morris, \"it is a capital idea to have all ready \\nin case we want to go horse backing, but don\\'t you think that one of your \\nsnappy carriages with its heraldic adornm ents in a byway of Walworth or Mile \\nEnd would attract too much attention for our purpose? It seems to me that we \\nought to take cabs when we go south or east. And even leave them somewhere \\nnear the neighbourhood we are going to.\"  \"Friend Quincey is right!\" said the Professor. \"His head is what you call in \\nplane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not \\nwant no peoples to watch us if so it may.\"  \\nMina took a growing interest in everyt hing and I was rejoiced to see that \\nthe exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible \\nexperience of the night. She was very, very pale, almost ghastly, and so thin \\nthat her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence. I \\ndid not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain, but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of wh at had occurred with poor Lucy when \\nthe Count had sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing \\nsharper, but the time as yet was shor t, and there was time for fear.  \\nWhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the \\ndisposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed \\nthat before starting for Piccadilly we sh ould destroy the Cou nt\\'s lair close at \\nhand. In case he should f ind it out too soon, we  should thus be still ahead of \\nhim in our work of destruction. And hi s presence in his purely material shape, \\nand at his weakest, might give us some new clue.  \\nAs to the disposal of forces, it was su ggested by the Professor that, after \\nour visit to Carfax, we should all ente r the house in Piccadi lly. That the two \\ndoctors and I should remain there, whils t Lord Godalming an d Quincey found \\nthe lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them . It was possible, if not \\nlikely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the \\nday, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there. At any \\nrate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously \\nobjected, and so far as my going was con cerned, for I said that I intended to \\nstay and protect Mina. I thought that my mind was made up on the subject, but \\nMina would not listen to my objection. Sh e said that there might be some law \\nmatter in which I could be useful. That amongst the Count\\'s papers might be \\nsome clue which I could u nderstand out of my experience in Transylvania. And \\nthat, as it was, all the strength we c ould muster was required to cope with the \\nCount\\'s extraordinary power. I had to give  in, for Mina\\'s resolution was fixed. \\nShe said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together.  \\n\"As for me,\" she said, \"I have no fear . Things have been as bad as they can \\nbe. And whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. \\nGo, my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.\"  So I started up crying out, \"Then in G od\\'s name let us come at once, for we \\nare losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think.\"  \\n\"Not so!\" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.  \\n\"But why?\" I asked.  \\n\"Do you forget,\" he said, with ac tually a smile, \"that last night he \\nbanqueted heavily, an d will sleep late?\"  \\nDid I forget! Shall I ever can I eve r! Can any of us ever forget that \\nterrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance, but the pain \\novermastered her and she put her hands be fore her face, and shuddered whilst \\nshe moaned. Van Helsing had not intende d to recall her frightful experience. \\nHe had simply lost sight of he r and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort.  \\nWhen it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness \\nand tried to comfort her.  \\n\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, \"dear, d ear, Madam Mina, alas! That I of all \\nwho so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old \\nlips of mine and this stupid old head do  not deserve so, but you will forget it, \\nwill you not?\" He bent low beside her as he spoke.  \\nShe took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, sa id hoarsely, \"No, \\nI shall not forget, for it is well that I remember. And with it I have so much in \\nmemory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together. Now, you must all be \\ngoing soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong.\"  \\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and \\nencourage each other, and Mina was the  brightest and most  cheerful of us. \\nWhen it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said, \"Now, my dear friends, we \\ngo forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we  all armed, as we were on that night \\nwhen first we visited our enemy\\'s lair. Armed against ghostly as well as carnal \\nattack?\"  \\nWe all assured him.  \\n\"Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite safe here \\nuntil the sunset. And before then we shall return if We shall return! But \\nbefore we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I have myself, since you came down, prepared y our chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard yourself. On your forehead I \\ntouch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and\"  \\nThere was a fearful scream which almost  froze our hearts to hear. As he \\nhad placed the Wafer on Mina\\'s forehead, it had seared it had burned into the \\nflesh as though it had been a piece of w hite-hot metal. My poor darling\\'s brain \\nhad told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the \\npain of it, and the two so overwhelme d her that her overwrought nature had its \\nvoice in that dreadful scream.  \\nBut the words to her thought came quickly. The echo of the scream had \\nnot ceased to ring on the air when there ca me the reaction, and she sank on her \\nknees on the floor in an agony of abaseme nt. Pulling her beautiful hair over her \\nface, as the leper of old hi s mantle, she wailed out.  \\n\"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must \\nbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgement Day.\"  \\nThey all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless \\ngrief, and putting my arms around he ld her tight. For a few minutes our \\nsorrowful hearts beat together, whilst th e friends around us turned away their \\neyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely. So \\ngravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was \\nstating things outside himself.  \\n\"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as \\nHe most surely shall, on the Judgement Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth \\nand of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, \\nmy dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of \\nGod\\'s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away \\nwhen God sees right to lift the burden that  is hard upon us. Till then we bear \\nour Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are \\nchosen instruments of His good pleasure,  and that we ascend to His bidding as \\nthat other through stripes an d shame. Through tears a nd blood. Through doubts \\nand fear, and all that makes the difference between God and man.\"  \\nThere was hope in his words, and comf ort. And they made  for resignation. \\nMina and I both felt so, and simultaneous ly we each took one of the old man\\'s \\nhands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and all ho lding hands, swore to be tr ue to each other. We men \\npledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved. And we pray ed for help and guidance in the terrible \\ntask which lay before us. It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a \\nparting which neither of us shall forget  to our dying day, and we set out.  \\nTo one thing I have made up my mind. If we find out that Mina must be a \\nvampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land \\nalone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many. Just as \\ntheir hideous bodies could only rest in s acred earth, so the holiest love was the \\nrecruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.  \\nWe entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the \\nfirst occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosai c surroundings of \\nneglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we \\nknew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible \\nmemories to spur us on, we could hardly  have proceeded with our task. We \\nfound no papers, or any sign of use in the house. And in the old chapel the \\ngreat boxes looked just as we had seen them last.  \\nDr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before him, \"And now, \\nmy friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilize this earth, so sacred of \\nholy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He \\nhas chosen this earth because it has be en holy. Thus we defeat him with his \\nown weapon, for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of \\nman, now we sanctify it to God.\"  \\nAs he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very \\nsoon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and \\nclose, but we did not somehow seem  to mind, for our attention was \\nconcentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer \\nhe laid it reverently on the earth, a nd then shutting down the  lid began to screw \\nit home, we aiding him as he worked.  \\nOne by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left \\nthem as we had found them to all appearan ce. But in each was a portion of the \\nHost. When we closed the door behind  us, the Professor said solemnly, \"So \\nmuch is already done. It may be that with  all the others we can be so successful, \\nthen the sunset of this evening may shin e of Madam Mina\\'s forehead all white \\nas ivory and with no stain!\"  \\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train \\nwe could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the window of \\nmy own room saw Mina. I waved my ha nd to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in reply to show that \\nshe understood. The last I saw, she wa s waving her hand in farewell. It was \\nwith a heavy heart that we sought the st ation and just caug ht the train, which \\nwas steaming in as we reached the platfor m. I have written th is in the train.  \\nPiccadilly, 12:30 o\\'clock.--J ust before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord \\nGodalming said to me, \"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty. For under the \\ncircumstances it wouldn\\'t seem so bad fo r us to break into an empty house. But \\nyou are a solicitor and the Incorporat ed Law Society might tell you that you \\nshould have known better.\"  \\nI demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on, \\n\"Besides, it will attract less attention if  there are not too many of us. My title \\nwill make it all right with the locksmi th, and with any policeman that may \\ncome along. You had better go with Ja ck and the Professor and stay in the \\nGreen Park. Somewhere in sight of the  house, and when you see the door \\nopened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on \\nthe lookout for you, and shall let you in.\"  \\n\"The advice is good!\" said Van Hels ing, so we said no more. Godalming \\nand Morris hurried off in a cab, we follow ing in another. At the corner of \\nArlington Street our contingent got out and strolled  into the Green Park. My \\nheart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, \\nlooming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view, and \\nbegan to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes \\nseemed to pass with leaden feet as we  waited for the coming of the others.  \\nAt length we saw a four-wheeler driv e up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, \\ngot Lord Godalming and Morris. And down  from the box descended a thick-set \\nworking man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. T ogether the two ascended the steps, and \\nLord Godalming pointed out what he wa nted done. The workman took off his \\ncoat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a \\npoliceman who just then sa untered along. The policem an nodded acquiescence, \\nand the man kneeling down placed his ba g beside him. After searching through \\nit, he took out a selection of tools whic h he proceeded to lay beside him in \\norderly fashion. Then he  stood up, looked in the keyhole, blew into it, and \\nturning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys. Selecting one of them, he began to \\nprobe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he \\ntried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push \\nfrom him, and he and the two others ente red the hall. We sat still. My own \\ncigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsin g\\'s went cold altogether. We waited \\npatiently as we saw the workman come out  and bring his bag.  Then he held the \\ndoor partly open, steadying  it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. \\nThis he finally handed to Lord Godalmin g, who took out hi s purse and gave \\nhim something. The man touched his hat,  took his bag, put on his coat and \\ndeparted. Not a soul took th e slightest notice of the  whole transaction.  \\nWhen the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at \\nthe door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood \\nLord Godalming lighting a cigar.  \\n\"The place smells so vilel y,\" said the latter as we came in. It did indeed \\nsmell vilely. Like the old chapel at Carf ax. And with our previous experience it \\nwas plain to us that the Count had be en using the place pretty freely. We \\nmoved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack, for we knew \\nwe had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know \\nwhether the Count might no t be in the house.  \\nIn the dining room, which lay at the b ack of the hall, we  found eight boxes \\nof earth. Eight boxes only o ut of the nine which we sought! Our work was not \\nover, and would never be until we should have fo und the missing box.  \\nFirst we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a \\nnarrow stone flagged yard at the blank face  of a stable, pointed to look like the \\nfront of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid \\nof being overlooked. We did not lose any time in examining the chests. With \\nthe tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and \\ntreated them as we had treated those othe rs in the old chapel. It was evident to \\nus that the Count was not at present in the house, a nd we proceeded to search \\nfor any of his effects.  \\nAfter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we \\ncame to the conclusion that the dining room  contained any effects which might \\nbelong to the Count. And so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay \\nin a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table.  \\nThere were title deeds of the Piccadil ly house in a great bundle, deeds of \\nthe purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey, notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping pa per to keep them \\nfrom the dust. There were also a clothe s brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and \\nbasin. The latter containing dirty wate r which was reddened as if with blood. \\nLast of all was a little heap of keys  of all sorts and sizes, probably those \\nbelonging to the other houses.  \\nWhen we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey \\nMorris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East \\nand the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch , and set out to destroy \\nthe boxes in these places. The rest of us  are, with what patience we can, waiting \\ntheir return, or the coming of the Count.  \\nCHAPTER 23  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n3 October.\\n--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the \\ncoming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our \\nminds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent purpose, by \\nthe side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The poor fellow is \\noverwhelmed in a misery that is appallin g to see. Last night he was a frank, \\nhappy-looking man, with strong, youthful  face, full of energy, and with dark \\nbrown hair. Today he is a drawn, hagga rd old man, whose white hair matches \\nwell with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His \\nenergy is still intact. In fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his \\nsalvation, for if all go well, it will tide  him over the despairing period. He will \\nthen, in a kind of way, wake again to th e realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought \\nmy own trouble was bad enough, but his !  \\nThe Professor knows this well enough, an d is doing his best to keep his \\nmind active. What he has been saying  was, under the circumstances, of \\nabsorbing interest. So well as I can remember, here it is:  \\n\"I have studied, over a nd over again since they cam e into my hands, all the \\npapers relating to this monster, and th e more I have studied, the greater seems \\nthe necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his \\nadvance. Not only of his power, but of hi s knowledge of it. As I learned from \\nthe researches of my friend Arminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most \\nwonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and al chemist--which latter was the highest development of the science knowledge of  his time. He had a mighty brain, a \\nlearning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He \\ndared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge \\nof his time that he did not essay.  \\n\"Well, in him the brain powers surv ived the physical death. Though it \\nwould seem that memory was not all com plete. In some faculties of mind he \\nhas been, and is, only a child. But he is growing, and some things that were \\nchildish at the first are now of man\\'s st ature. He is experimenting, and doing it \\nwell. And if it had not been that we have  crossed his path he would be yet, he \\nmay be yet if we fail, the father or fu rtherer of a new order of beings, whose \\nroad must lead through Death, not Life.\"  \\nHarker groaned and said, \"And this is all arrayed against my darling! But \\nhow is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\"  \\n\"He has all along, since his coming, been trying  his power, slowly but \\nsurely. That big child-bra in of his is working. Well for us, it is as yet a child-\\nbrain. For had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago \\nhave been beyond our power. However,  he means to succee d, and a man who \\nhas centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may \\nwell be his motto.\"  \\n\"I fail to understand,\" said Harker wearily. \"Oh, do be  more plain to me! \\nPerhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\"  \\nThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke, \"Ah, my \\nchild, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late , this monster has been \\ncreeping into knowledge expe rimentally. How he has been making use of the \\nzoophagous patient to effect his entr y into friend John\\'s home. For your \\nVampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at \\nthe first make entry only when asked ther eto by an inmate. But these are not his \\nmost important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great \\nboxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. But all the \\ntime that so great child-brain of his wa s growing, and he began to consider \\nwhether he might not himself move the bo x. So he began to help. And then, \\nwhen he found that this be  all right, he try to move them all alone. And so he \\nprogress, and he scatter these graves of  him. And none but he know where they \\nare hidden.  \\n\"He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So that only he use \\nthem in the night, or at su ch time as he can change his form, they do him equal well, and none may know these are his hiding place! But, my child, do not \\ndespair, this knowledge came to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but \\none be sterilize as for him. And before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have \\nno place where he can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might \\nbe sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why not be more \\ncareful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend \\nArthur and Quincey are on their way to us. Today is our day, and we must go \\nsure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! There are five of us when those absent \\nones return.\"  \\nWhilst we were speaking we were star tled by a knock at the hall door, the \\ndouble postman\\'s knock of the telegra ph boy. We all moved out to the hall with \\none impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, \\nstepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a dispatch. The Professor \\nclosed the door again, and after looking at the direction, opened it and read \\naloud.  \\n\"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:4 5, come from Carfax hurriedly and \\nhastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want to \\nsee you: Mina.\"  \\nThere was a pause, broken by Jonatha n Harker\\'s voice, \"Now, God be \\nthanked, we shall soon meet!\"  \\nVan Helsing turned to him quickly and said, \"God will act in His own way \\nand time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet. For what we wish for at the \\nmoment may be our own undoings.\"  \\n\"I care for nothing now,\" he answered ho tly, \"except to wipe  out this brute \\nfrom the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!\"  \\n\"Oh, hush, hush, my child!\" said Va n Helsing. \"God does not purchase \\nsouls in this wise, and the Devil, thoug h he may purchase, does not keep faith. \\nBut God is merciful and just , and knows your pain a nd your devotion to that \\ndear Madam Mina. Think you, how he r pain would be doubled, did she but \\nhear your wild words. Do not fear any of  us, we are all devoted to this cause, \\nand today shall see the end. The time is  coming for action. Today this Vampire \\nis limit to the powers of man, and till  sunset he may not change. It will take \\nhim time to arrive here, see it is twen ty minutes past one, and there are yet \\nsome times before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must \\nhope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\"  About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker\\'s telegram, there \\ncame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary knock, \\nsuch as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor\\'s \\nheart and mine beat loudly.  We looked at each other, and together moved out \\ninto the hall. We each held ready to use our various armaments, the spiritual in \\nthe left hand, the mortal in the right.  Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and \\nholding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The \\ngladness of our hearts must have shown up on our faces when on the step, close \\nto the door, we saw Lord Godalming an d Quincey Morris. They came quickly \\nin and closed the door behi nd them, the former saying, as they moved along the \\nhall:  \\n\"It is all right. We found both places . Six boxes in each and we destroyed \\nthem all.\"  \\n\"Destroyed?\" asked the Professor.  \\n\"For him!\" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said, \"There\\'s \\nnothing to do but to wait here. If, however , he doesn\\'t turn up by five o\\'clock, \\nwe must start off. For it won\\'t do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.\"  \\n\"He will be here before long now,\" said Van Helsing, who had been \\nconsulting his pocketbook. \"Nota bene, in Madam\\'s telegram he went south \\nfrom Carfax. That means he went to cros s the river, and he could only do so at \\nslack of tide, which should be somethi ng before one o\\'clock. That he went \\nsouth has a meaning for us. He is as  yet only suspicious, and he went from \\nCarfax first to the place where he woul d suspect interference least. You must \\nhave been at Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here \\nalready shows that he went to Mile End ne xt. This took him some time, for he \\nwould then have to be carried over th e river in some way. Believe me, my \\nfriends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Be ready!\" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we \\nall could hear a key softly inserted  in the lock of the hall door.  \\nI could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a \\ndominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in \\ndifferent parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him \\nimplicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinct ively. With a swift \\nglance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and without \\nspeaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in positio n. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the \\nProfessor could guard it whilst we tw o stepped between the incomer and the \\ndoor. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to \\nmove in front of the window. We waite d in a suspense that made the seconds \\npass with nightmare slowne ss. The slow, careful step s came along the hall. The \\nCount was evidently prepared for some surprise, at least he feared it.  \\nSuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room. Winning a way past \\nus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something so pantherlike in the movement, something so  unhuman, that it seemed to sober us \\nall from the shock of his coming. The fi rst to act was Harker, who with a quick \\nmovement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of \\nthe house. As the Count saw us, a horribl e sort of snarl passed over his face, \\nshowing the eyeteeth long and pointed. But the evil smile as quickly passed \\ninto a cold stare of lion-li ke disdain. His expression again changed as, with a \\nsingle impulse, we all ad vanced upon him. It was a p ity that we had not some \\nbetter organized plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whethe r our lethal weapon s would avail us \\nanything.  \\nHarker evidently meant to try the matte r, for he had ready his great Kukri \\nknife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a powerful one; \\nonly the diabolical quickness of the Count\\' s leap back saved him. A second less \\nand the trenchant blade had shorn through his  heart. As it was, the point just cut \\nthe cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a \\nstream of gold fell out. Th e expression of the Count\\'s face was so he llish, that \\nfor a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinct ively I moved forward with a protective \\nimpulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power \\nfly along my arm, and it was without surprise that  I saw the monster cower \\nback before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity, of anger and hellish rage , which came over the Cou nt\\'s face. His waxen hue \\nbecame greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, a nd the red scar on \\nthe forehead showed on th e pallid skin like a palpit ating wound. The next \\ninstant, with a sinuous dive he swept un der Harker\\'s arm, ere his blow could \\nfall, and grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window. Amid  the crash and glitt er of the falling \\nglass, he tumbled into the flagged area  below. Through the sound of the \\nshivering glass I could hear the \"ting\" of  the gold, as some of the sovereigns \\nfell on the flagging.  We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up \\nthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he \\nturned and spoke to us.  \\n\"You think to baffle me, you with your pale faces all in a row, like sheep \\nin a butcher\\'s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think you have left \\nme without a place to rest, but I have more. My revenge is just begun! I spread \\nit over centuries, and time is on my side. Y our girls that you all love are mine \\nalready. And through them you and others shall yet be mine, my creatures, to \\ndo my bidding and to be my jack als when I want to feed. Bah!\"  \\nWith a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we \\nheard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us to speak was th e Professor. Realizing the difficulty of \\nfollowing him through the stable , we moved toward the hall.  \\n\"We have learnt something much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he \\nfears us. He fears time, he fears want! For if not, why he hurry so? His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You follow quick. \\nYou are hunters of the wild beast, and und erstand it so. For me, I make sure \\nthat nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he returns.\"  \\nAs he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket, took the title deeds \\nin the bundle as Harker had left them,  and swept the remaining things into the \\nopen fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match.  \\nGodalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had \\nlowered himself from the window to fo llow the Count. He had, however, \\nbolted the stable door, and by the time th ey had forced it open there was no \\nsign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to ma ke inquiry at the back of the house. \\nBut the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.  \\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to \\nrecognize that our game was up. With heavy hearts we agreed with the \\nProfessor when he said, \"Let us go back to Madam Mina. Poor, poor dear \\nMadam Mina. All we can do just now is done, and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need not despair. There is but one more earth box, and we \\nmust try to find it. When that is done all may yet be well.\"  \\nI could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The \\npoor fellow was quite broken down, now and again he gave a low groan which \\nhe could not suppress. He was thinking of his wife.  With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker \\nwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerf ulness which did honour to her bravery \\nand unselfishness. When sh e saw our faces, her own b ecame as pale as death. \\nFor a second or two her eyes were closed  as if she were in secret prayer.  \\nAnd then she said cheerfully, \"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my \\npoor darling!\"  \\nAs she spoke, she took her husband\\'s grey head in her ha nds and kissed it.  \\n\"Lay your poor head here and rest it . All will yet be well, dear! God will \\nprotect us if He so will it in His go od intent.\" The poor fe llow groaned. There \\nwas no place for words in his sublime misery.  \\nWe had a sort of perfunctory supper to gether, and I think it cheered us all \\nup somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people, \\nfor none of us had eaten anything since breakfast, or the sense of companionship may have helped us, but anyhow we were all less miserable, \\nand saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.  \\nTrue to our promise, we told Mrs. Ha rker everything which had passed. \\nAnd although she grew snowy white at  times when danger had seemed to \\nthreaten her husband, and red at othe rs when his devotion to her was \\nmanifested, she listened bravely and wi th calmness. When we came to the part \\nwhere Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clu ng to her husband\\'s \\narm, and held it tight as though her cl inging could protect him from any harm \\nthat might come. She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought up to the present time.  \\nThen without letting go he r husband\\'s hand she st ood up amongst us and \\nspoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene. Of that sweet, sweet, good, \\ngood woman in all the radiant beauty of  her youth and animation, with the red \\nscar on her forehead, of which she wa s conscious, and which we saw with \\ngrinding of our teeth, remembering whence and how it came. Her loving \\nkindness against our grim hate. Her tender faith against all our fears and \\ndoubting. And we, kn owing that so far as symbols went, she with all her \\ngoodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God.  \\n\"Jonathan,\" she said, and the word so unded like music on her lips it was so \\nfull of love and tenderness, \"Jonathan dear , and you all my true, true friends, I \\nwant you to bear something in mind thr ough all this dreadful time. I know that \\nyou must fight. That you must destroy ev en as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter. But it is not a work of hate. That poor \\nsoul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what \\nwill be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in  his worser part that his better part \\nmay have spiritual immortality. You mu st be pitiful to him , too, though it may \\nnot hold your hands from  his destruction.\"  \\nAs she spoke I could see her husband\\'s face darken and draw together, as \\nthough the passion in him were shriveling his being to its core. Instinctively the \\nclasp on his wife\\'s hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white. She did not \\nflinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered, but looked at him \\nwith eyes that were more appealing than ever.  \\nAs she stopped speaking he leaped to hi s feet, almost tearing his hand from \\nhers as he spoke.  \\n\"May God give him into my hand ju st for long enough to destroy that \\nearthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send his soul \\nforever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\"  \\n\"Oh, hush! Oh, hush in the name of the  good God. Don\\'t say such things, \\nJonathan, my husband, or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just think, \\nmy dear I have been thinking all this  long, long day of it that perhaps \\nsome day I, too, may need such pity, and that some other li ke you, and with \\nequal cause for anger, may deny it to me! Oh, my husband! My husband, \\nindeed I would have spared you such a thought had there b een another way. \\nBut I pray that God may not have treasur ed your wild words, except as the \\nheart-broken wail of a very loving and so rely stricken man. Oh, God, let these \\npoor white hairs go in evidence of what  he has suffered, who all his life has \\ndone no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come.\"  \\nWe men were all in tears now. Ther e was no resisting them, and we wept \\nopenly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed. Her \\nhusband flung himself on his knees beside  her, and putting his arms round her, \\nhid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole \\nout of the room, leaving the two lov ing hearts alone with their God.  \\nBefore they retired the Professor fixe d up the room against any coming of \\nthe Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace. She tried to \\nschool herself to the belief, and manifestly for her husband\\'s sake, tried to seem \\ncontent. It was a brave struggle, and was, I think and belie ve, not without its \\nreward. Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to \\nsound in case of any emergency. When  they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should sit up, di viding the night betw een us, and watch \\nover the safety of the poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so \\nthe rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can.  \\nGodalming has already turned in, for his  is the second watch. Now that my \\nwork is done I, too, shall go to bed.  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  3-4 October, close to midnight.--I th ought yesterday would never end. \\nThere was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to \\nwake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the \\nbetter. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we \\ncould arrive at no result. All we kne w was that one earth box remained, and \\nthat the Count alone knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may \\nbaffle us for years. And in the meantime, the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know, that if  ever there was a woman who was all \\nperfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I loved her a thousand times \\nmore for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the \\nmonster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer \\nby the loss of such a creatur e. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards \\nnow, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping \\nwithout dreams. I fear what her dream s might be like, with such terrible \\nmemories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since \\nthe sunset. Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like \\nspring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that it was the softness of \\nthe red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I \\nam not sleepy myself, though I am weary  weary to death. However, I must \\ntry to sleep. For there is tomorrow to th ink of, and there is no rest for me \\nuntil  \\nLater--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by Mina, who was \\nsitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily, for we did \\nnot leave the room in darkness. She had placed a warning hand over my mouth, \\nand now she whispered in my ear, \"Hush!  There is someone in the corridor!\" I \\ngot up softly, and crossing the r oom, gently opened the door.  Just outside, stretched on a mattre ss, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He \\nraised a warning hand for silence as he  whispered to me, \"Hush! Go back to \\nbed. It is all right. One of us will be here all night. We don\\'t mean to take any \\nchances!\"  \\nHis look and gesture forbade discussi on, so I came back and told Mina. \\nShe sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale face as \\nshe put her arms round me and said softly, \"Oh, thank God for good brave \\nmen!\" With a sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am not \\nsleepy, though I must try again.  \\n4 October, morning.--Once again dur ing the night I was wakened by Mina. \\nThis time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was \\nmaking the windows into sharp oblongs, a nd the gas flame was like a speck \\nrather than a disc of light.  \\nShe said to me hurriedly, \"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at \\nonce.\"  \\n\"Why?\" I asked.  \\n\"I have an idea. I suppose it must  have come in the night, and matured \\nwithout my knowing it. He must hypnot ize me before the dawn, and then I \\nshall be able to speak. Go quick, d earest, the time is getting close.\"  \\nI went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and seeing me, \\nhe sprang to his feet.  \\n\"Is anything wrong?\" he asked, in alarm.  \\n\"No,\" I replied. \"But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.\"  \\n\"I will go,\" he said, and hurried into the Professor\\'s room.  \\nTwo or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing \\ngown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door \\nasking questions. When the Professor sa w Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted \\nthe anxiety of his face.  He rubbed his hands as he said, \"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed \\na change. See! Friend Jonathan, we ha ve got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, \\nback to us today!\" Then turning to her, he  said cheerfully, \"And what am I to \\ndo for you? For at this hour y ou do not want me for nothing.\"  \\n\"I want you to hypnotize me!\" she said . \"Do it before the dawn, for I feel \\nthat then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!\" \\nWithout a word he motioned  her to sit up in bed.  \\nLooking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from \\nover the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him \\nfixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, \\nfor I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, \\nstock still. Only by the gentle heavi ng of her bosom cou ld one know that she \\nwas alive. The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes, but she did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away \\nlook in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. \\nRaising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the \\nothers in. They came on tiptoe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the \\nfoot of the bed, looking on. Mina appear ed not to see them. The stillness was \\nbroken by Van Helsing\\'s voice speaking in a low level tone which would not \\nbreak the current of her thoughts.  \\n\"Where are you?\" The answer came in a neutral way.  \\n\"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.\" For several minutes \\nthere was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly.  \\nThe rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing lighter. \\nWithout taking his eyes from Mina\\'s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull \\nup the blind. I did so, and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, \\nand a rosy light seemed to diffuse itsel f through the room. On the instant the \\nProfessor spoke again.  \\n\"Where are you now?\"  The answer came dreamily, but with intent ion. It were as though she were \\ninterpreting something. I have heard he r use the same tone when reading her \\nshorthand notes.  \\n\"I do not know. It is all strange to me!\"  \"What do you see?\"  \\n\"I can see nothing. It is all dark.\"  \\n\"What do you hear?\" I could detect the strain in the Professor\\'s patient \\nvoice.  \\n\"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can hear \\nthem on the outside.\"  \\n\"Then you are on a ship?\\'\"  We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other. \\nWe were afraid to think.  \\nThe answer came quick, \"Oh, yes!\"  \\n\"What else do you hear?\"  \\n\"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the \\ncreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the \\nratchet.\"  \\n\"What are you doing?\"  \"I am still, oh so still. It is like death!\" The voice faded away into a deep \\nbreath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.  \\nBy this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day. Dr. \\nVan Helsing placed his hands on Mina\\'s shoulders, and laid her head down \\nsoftly on her pillow. She lay like a slee ping child for a few moments, and then, \\nwith a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her.  \\n\"Have I been talking in my sleep?\" was all she said. She seemed, however, \\nto know the situation withou t telling, though she was eager to know what she \\nhad told. The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said, \"Then there is \\nnot a moment to lose. It may not be yet too late!\"  \\nMr. Morris and Lord Godalming starte d for the door but the Professor\\'s \\ncalm voice called them back.  \\n\"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor at the \\nmoment in your so great Port of London.  Which of them is it that you seek? God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us \\nwe know not. We have been blind somewh at. Blind after the manner of men, \\nsince we can look back we see what we might have s een looking forward if we \\nhad been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a \\npuddle, is it not? We can know now wh at was in the Count\\'s mind, when he \\nseize that money, though Jonathan\\'s so  fierce knife put him in the danger that \\neven he dread. He meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth box left, and a pack of men followi ng like dogs after a fox, this London \\nwas no place for him. He have take his la st earth box on board a ship, and he \\nleave the land. He think to escape, bu t no! We follow him. Tally Ho! As friend \\nArthur would say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily. Oh! So \\nwily, and we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily  and I think his mind in a \\nlittle while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are between us \\nwhich he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would. Unless the \\nship were to touch the land, and then only  at full or slack tide. See, and the sun \\nis just rose, and all day to sunset is us . Let us take bath, and dress, and have \\nbreakfast which we all need, and which we  can eat comfortably since he be not \\nin the same land with us.\"  \\nMina looked at him appe alingly as she asked, \"But why need we seek him \\nfurther, when he is gone away from us?\"  \\nHe took her hand and patted it as he  replied, \"Ask me nothing as yet. \\nWhen we have breakfast, then I answer  all questions.\" He would say no more, \\nand we separated to dress.  \\nAfter breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for a \\nminute and then said sorrowfully, \"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if  we have to follow him to the jaws of \\nHell!\"  \\nShe grew paler as she asked faintly, \"Why?\"  \\n\"Because,\" he answered solemnly, \"h e can live for centu ries, and you are \\nbut mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded, since once he put that mark \\nupon your throat.\"  \\nI was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.  \\n CHAPTER 24  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY  \\nSPOKEN BY VAN HELSI\\nNG  \\nThis to Jonathan Harker.  \\nYou are to stay with your dear Mada m Mina. We shall go to make our \\nsearch, if I can call it so, for it is not search but know ing, and we seek \\nconfirmation only. But do you stay and take  care of her today. This is your best \\nand most holiest office. This day nothing can find him here.  \\nLet me tell you that so you will know what we four know already, for I \\nhave tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away. He have gone back to his \\nCastle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on \\nthe wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth box was \\nready to ship somewheres. For this he took the money. For this he hurry at the \\nlast, lest we catch him before the sun go down. It was his last hope, save that he \\nmight hide in the tomb that he think poor  Miss Lucy, being as he thought like \\nhim, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that fail he make \\nstraight for his last resource, his last earth-work I might say did I wish double \\nentente. He is clever, oh so clever! He know that his game here was finish. And so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came, and he \\ngo in it.  \\nWe go off now to find what ship, a nd whither bound. When we have \\ndiscover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will comfort you and \\npoor Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope when you think it over, \\nthat all is not lost. This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years \\nto get so far as London. And yet in one da y, when we know of the disposal of \\nhim we drive him out. He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and \\nsuffers not as we do. But we are stro ng, each in our purpose, and we are all \\nmore strong together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This \\nbattle is but begun and in the end we shall win. So sure as that God sits on high \\nto watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.  \\nVAN HELSING.  \\n  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n4 October.--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing\\'s message in the \\nphonograph, the poor girl brightened up  considerably. Already the certainty \\nthat the Count is out of the country ha s given her comfort. And comfort is \\nstrength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to \\nface with us, it seems almost impossible to  believe in it. Even my own terrible \\nexperiences in Castle Dracula seem like  a long forgotten dream. Here in the \\ncrisp autumn air in the bright sunlight.  \\nAlas! How can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the \\nred scar on my poor darling\\'s white foreh ead. Whilst that lasts, there can be no \\ndisbelief. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again \\nand again. Somehow, although the realit y seem greater each time, the pain and \\nthe fear seem less. There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comfor ting. Mina says that perhap s we are the instruments \\nof ultimate good. It may be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never \\nspoken to each other yet of the future.  It is better to wait till we see the \\nProfessor and the others after their investigations.  \\nThe day is running by more quickly th an I ever thought a day could run for \\nme again. It is now three o\\'clock.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n5 October, 5 P.M.--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van Helsing, \\nLord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quinc ey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina \\nHarker.  \\nDr. Van Helsing described what step s were taken during the day to \\ndiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape.  \\n\"As I knew that he wanted to get back to  Transylvania, I felt sure that he \\nmust go by the Danube mouth, or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that \\nway he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro \\nmagnifico ; and so with heavy hearts we star t to find what ships leave for the \\nBlack Sea last night. He was in saili ng ship, since Madam M ina tell of sails \\nbeing set. These not so important as to go  in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by su ggestion of Lord Godalming,  to your Lloyd\\'s, where \\nare note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one \\nBlack Sea bound ship go out with the tide . She is the Czarina Catherine, and \\nshe sail from Doolittle\\'s Wharf for Varna, and thence to other ports and up the \\nDanube. \\'So!\\' said I, \\'this is the ship whereon is the Count.\\' So off we go to \\nDoolittle\\'s Wharf, and there we find a ma n in an office. From him we inquire of \\nthe goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear mu ch, and he red face and loud \\nof voice, but he good fellow all the same. And when Quincey give him \\nsomething from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so \\nsmall bag which he have hid deep in hi s clothing, he still better fellow and \\nhumble servant to us. He come with us , and ask many men who are rough and \\nhot. These be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say \\nmuch of blood and bloom, and of othe rs which I comprehend not, though I \\nguess what they mean. But nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to \\nknow.  \\n\"They make known to us among them, how  last afternoon at about five \\no\\'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and \\nteeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except \\nthat he have a hat of straw which suit no t him or the time. That he scatter his \\nmoney in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for \\nwhere. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gangpla nk, and ask that the captain come to him. \\nThe captain come, when told that he will be pay well, and though he swear \\nmuch at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on whic h a great box. This he hi mself lift down, though it \\ntake several to put it on truck for the sh ip. He give much talk to captain as to \\nhow and where his box is to be place. But the captain like it not and swear at \\nhim in many tongues, and tell  him that if he like he can come and see where it \\nshall be. But he say \\'no,\\' that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick, with blood, for that \\nhis ship will leave the place, of blood, before the turn of the tide, with blood. \\nThen the thin man smile and say that of c ourse he must go when he think fit, \\nbut he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swea r again, polyglot, \\nand the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far \\nintrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tong ues, tell him that he doesn\\'t want no \\nFrenchmen, with bloom upon them and also with blood, in hi s ship, with blood \\non her also. And so, after asking wher e he might purchase ship forms, he \\ndeparted.  \"No one knew where he went \\'or bloomin\\' well cared\\' as they said, for they \\nhad something else to think of, well w ith blood again. For it soon became \\napparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected. A \\nthin mist began to creep up from the r iver, and it grew, a nd grew. Till soon a \\ndense fog enveloped the ship and all ar ound her. The captain swore polyglot, \\nvery polyglot, polyglot with  bloom and blood,  but he could do nothing. The \\nwater rose and rose, and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. \\nHe was in no friendly mood, when jus t at full tide, the thin man came up the \\ngangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the \\ncaptain replied that he wished that he and his box, old and with much bloom \\nand blood, were in hell. But the thin man did not be  offend, and went down \\nwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on \\ndeck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him. Indeed \\nthey thought not of him, for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear \\nagain. My friends of the thirst and th e language that was of bloom and blood \\nlaughed, as they told how the captain\\'s sw ears exceeded even his usual polyglot, \\nand was more than ever full of pic turesque, when on questioning other \\nmariners who were on movement up and down the river that hour, he found \\nthat few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. \\nHowever, the ship went out on the ebb tide, and was doubtle ss by morning far \\ndown the river mouth. She was then, when they told us, well out to sea.  \\n\"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our \\nenemy is on the sea, with the fog at  his command, on his way to the Danube \\nmouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick. And when we start to \\ngo on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope is to come on \\nhim when in the box between sunrise and sunset. For then he can make no \\nstruggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in \\nwhich we can make ready our plan. We know all about where he go. For we have seen the owner of the  ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers \\nthat can be. The box we seek is to be la nded in Varna, and to be given to an \\nagent, one Ristics who will  there present his credenti als. And so our merchant \\nfriend will have done his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, \\nhe can telegraph and have in quiry made at Varna, we sa y \\'no,\\' for what is to be \\ndone is not for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our \\nown way.\"  \\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking , I asked him if he were certain \\nthat the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied, \"We have the best proof of that, your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning.\"  I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the \\nCount, for oh! I dread Jonathan leavi ng me, and I know that he would surely go \\nif the others went. He answered in growi ng passion, at first quietly. As he went \\non, however, he grew more angry and mo re forceful, till in the end we could \\nnot but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made \\nhim so long a master amongst men.  \\n\"Yes, it is necessary, neces sary, necessary! For your sake in the first, and \\nthen for the sake of humanity. This mo nster has done much harm already, in \\nthe narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he \\nwas only as a body groping his so sm all measure in darkness and not knowing. \\nAll this have I told these others. You,  my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the \\nphonograph of my friend John, or in tha t of your husband. I have told them \\nhow the measure of leaving his own barren land, barren of peoples, and coming \\nto a new land where life of man t eems till they are like the multitude of \\nstanding corn, was the work  of centuries. Were another of the Undead, like him, \\nto try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that \\nhave been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some \\nwonderous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Undead for all these \\ncenturies, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are \\ndeep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, \\nand gases that kill or make to vivify. D oubtless, there is something magnetic or \\nelectric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way, and in himself were from  the first some great qualities. In a \\nhard and warlike time he was celebrate  that he have more iron nerve, more \\nsubtle brain, more braver heart, than an y man. In him some vital principle have \\nin strange way found their utmost. And as his body keep strong and grow and \\nthrive, so his brain grow too.  All this without that diab olic aid which is surely \\nto him. For it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have infect you, oh forgive me, my dear, that I must say such, but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live, to live in your \\nown old, sweet way, and so in time, d eath, which is of man\\'s common lot and \\nwith God\\'s sanction, shall ma ke you like to him. This must not be! We have \\nsworn together that it must not. Thus ar e we ministers of God\\'s own wish. That \\nthe world, and men for whom His Son die,  will not be given over to monsters, \\nwhose very existence would defame Him.  He have allowed us to redeem one \\nsoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunr ise. And like them, if we fall, we fall \\nin good cause.\"  \\nHe paused and I said, \"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since \\nhe has been driven from England, will he  not avoid it, as a tiger does the village \\nfrom which he has been hunted?\"  \\n\"Aha!\" he said, \"your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt \\nhim. Your maneater, as they of India ca ll the tiger who has once tasted blood of \\nthe human, care no more for the other pr ey, but prowl unceasing till he get him. \\nThis that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a maneater, and he never \\ncease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, \\nhis living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack hi s enemy on his own \\nground. He be beaten back, but did he st ay? No! He come again, and again, and \\nagain. Look at his persistence and endu rance. With the chil d-brain that was to \\nhim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does \\nhe do? He find out the place of all the wo rld most of promise for him. Then he \\ndeliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just \\nhow is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life, new environment of old wa ys, the politics, the law, the finance, \\nthe science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be \\nsince he was. His glimpse that he have ha d, whet his appetite only and enkeen \\nhis desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to  his brain. For it all prove to him how \\nright he was at the first in his surmises . He have done this alone, all alone! \\nFrom a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the \\ngreater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know \\nhim. Who can flourish in the midst of disea ses that kill off whole peoples. Oh! \\nIf such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good \\nmight he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, an d our efforts all in secret. For in this \\nenlightened age, when men believe not ev en what they see,  the doubting of \\nwise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his \\narmor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who ar e willing to peril \\neven our own souls for the safety of one we love. For the good of mankind, and \\nfor the honour and glory of God.\"  \\nAfter a general discussion it was dete rmined that for tonight nothing be \\ndefinitely settled. That we should all sl eep on the facts, and try to think out the \\nproper conclusions. Tomorrow, at breakf ast, we are to meet again, and after \\nmaking our conclusions know n to one another, we shall decide on some \\ndefinite cause of action  I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.  It is as if some haunting presence \\nwere removed from me. Perhaps  \\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be, for I caught sight in the mirror \\nof the red mark upon my forehead, a nd I knew that I was still unclean.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n5 October.--We all arose early, and I think that sleep did much for each \\nand all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more general \\ncheerfulness than any of us had ever  expected to experience again.  \\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let \\nany obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even by death, \\nand we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as \\nwe sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red \\nblotch on Mrs. Harker\\'s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, \\nwhen I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realize that \\nthe cause of all our trouble is still ex istent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose \\nsight of her trouble for whole spells. It  is only now and again, when something \\nrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in \\nmy study in half an hour  and decide on our course  of action. I see only one \\nimmediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason. We shall all have to speak frankly. And yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. \\nHarker\\'s tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from \\nall that has been I can gues s how brilliant and how true they must be. But she \\nwill not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have menti oned this to Van Helsing, \\nand he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that \\nhorrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had \\nhis own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \"the Vampire\\'s \\nbaptism of blood.\" Well, there may be a poison that distills itself out of good \\nthings. In an age when the existence of ptomaines is a myst ery we should not \\nwonder at anything! One thin g I know, that if my ins tinct be true regarding \\npoor Mrs. Harker\\'s silences, then there  is a terrible difficulty, an unknown \\ndanger, in the work before us. The sa me power that compels her silence may \\ncompel her speech. I dare not think fu rther, for so I sh ould in my thoughts \\ndishonour a noble woman!   \\nLater.--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things. I \\ncould see that he had some thing on his mind, which he wanted to say, but felt \\nsome hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a \\nlittle, he said, \"Friend John, there is so mething that you and I must talk of alone, \\njust at the first at any rate. Later, we  may have to take the others into our \\nconfidence.\"  \\nThen he stopped, so I waited. He went on, \"Madam Mina, our poor, dear \\nMadam Mina is changing.\"  \\nA cold shiver ran through me to find  my worst fears thus endorsed. Van \\nHelsing continued.  \\n\"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned \\nbefore things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and \\nthis new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see the \\ncharacteristics of the vampir e coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight. \\nBut it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without prejudge. Her teeth are \\nsharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often, as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even \\nwhen she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. \\nIf it be that she can, by our hypnotic tran ce, tell what the Count see and hear, is \\nit not more true that he who have hypnotiz e her first, and who have drink of her \\nvery blood and make her drink of his, should if he will, compel her mind to \\ndisclose to him that which she know?\"  \\nI nodded acquiescence. He went on, \"The n, what we must do is to prevent \\nthis. We must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she \\nknow not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heartbreak me to think of it, but it must be. When today we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we \\nwill not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded \\nby us.\"  \\nHe wiped his forehead, which had brok en out in profuse perspiration at the \\nthought of the pain which he might have to  inflict upon the poor soul already so \\ntortured. I knew that it would be some sort  of comfort to him if I told him that I \\nalso had come to the same conclusion. Fo r at any rate it would take away the \\npain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I expected.  It is now close to the time of our ge neral gathering. Van Helsing has gone \\naway to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I really believe his \\npurpose is to be able to pray alone.  \\nLater.--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was \\nexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a message \\nby her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it \\nbetter that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to \\nembarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each othe r for an instant, and \\nsomehow we both seemed relieved. For my own part, I thou ght that if Mrs. \\nHarker realized the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agre ed, by a questioning look and answer, \\nwith finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, un til we should have \\nbeen able to confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign.  \\nVan Helsing roughly put the facts before  us first, \"The Czarina Catherine \\nleft the Thames yesterday morning. It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna. But we can travel overland \\nto the same place in three days. Now, if we allow for two days less for the \\nship\\'s voyage, owing to such weather inf luences as we know that the Count can \\nbring to bear, and if we a llow a whole day and night for any delays which may \\noccur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks.  \\n\"Thus, in order to be quite safe, we mu st leave here on 17th at latest. Then \\nwe shall at any rate be in Varna a day be fore the ship arrives, and able to make \\nsuch preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed, armed \\nagainst evil things, spiritua l as well as physical.\"  \\nHere Quincey Morris added, \"I un derstand that the Count comes from a \\nwolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us. I propose that we \\nadd Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when \\nthere is any trouble of that sort around.  Do you remember, Art, when we had \\nthe pack after us at Tobolsk? What wou ldn\\'t we have given then for a repeater \\napiece!\"  \\n\"Good!\" said Van Helsing, \"Winchester s it shall be. Quincey\\'s head is \\nlevel at times, but most so when there is  to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour \\nto science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we can do nothing \\nhere. And as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as  there. Tonight and tomorrow we can get \\nready, and then if all be well, we four can set out on our journey.\"  \\n\"We four?\" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.  \\n\"Of course!\" answered the Professo r quickly. \"You must remain to take \\ncare of your so sweet wife!\"  \\nHarker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice, \"Let us talk \\nof that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.\"  \\nI thought that now was the time fo r Van Helsing to warn him not to \\ndisclose our plan to her, but he took no notice. I looked at him significantly and \\ncoughed. For answer he put his f inger to his lips an d turned away.  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n5 October, afternoon.--For some tim e after our meeting this morning I \\ncould not think. The new phases of thing s leave my mind in a state of wonder \\nwhich allows no room for active thought.  Mina\\'s determination not to take any \\npart in the discussion set me  thinking. And as I cou ld not argue the matter with \\nher, I could only guess. I am as far as  ever from a solution now. The way the \\nothers received it, too puzzled me. The last time we talked of the subject we \\nagreed that there was to be no more con cealment of anything amongst us. Mina \\nis sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a littl e child. Her lips are curved and \\nher face beams with ha ppiness. Thank God, there are su ch moments still for her.  \\nLater.--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina\\'s happy sleep, and I came \\nas near to being happy myself as I suppos e I shall ever be. As the evening drew \\non, and the earth took its sh adows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the \\nroom grew more and more solemn to me.  \\nAll at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly said, \\n\"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A \\npromise made to me, but made holily in  God\\'s hearing, a nd not to be broken \\nthough I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter  tears. Quick, \\nyou must make it to me at once.\"  \"Mina,\" I said, \"a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have no \\nright to make it.\"  \\n\"But, dear one,\" she said, with such s piritual intensity that her eyes were \\nlike pole stars, \"it is I who wish it. A nd it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. \\nVan Helsing if I am not right. If he disagrees you may do as you will. Nay, \\nmore if you all agree, later you are absolved from the promise.\"  \\n\"I promise!\" I said, and for a mo ment she looked supremely happy. \\nThough to me all happiness for her was de nied by the red scar on her forehead.  \\nShe said, \"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans \\nformed for the campaign against the Co unt. Not by word, or inference, or \\nimplication, not at any time whilst th is remains to me!\" And she solemnly \\npointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly, \"I \\npromise!\" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut \\nbetween us.  \\nLater, midnight.--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening. So \\nmuch so that all the rest seemed to take  courage, as if infected somewhat with \\nher gaiety. As a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs \\nus down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like \\na little child. It is wonderful thing that he r faculty of sleep remains to her in the \\nmidst of her terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget \\nher care. Perhaps her example may affect  me as her gaiety did tonight. I shall \\ntry it. Oh! For a dreamless sleep.  \\n6 October, morning.--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the \\nsame time as yesterday, and asked me  to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought that \\nit was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him dressed \\nin his room. His door was ajar, so that he  could hear the opening of the door of \\nour room. He came at once. As he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the \\nothers might come, too.  \\n\"No,\" she said quite simply, \"it will not be necessary. You can tell them \\njust as well. I must go w ith you on your journey.\"  \\nDr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment\\'s pause he asked, \\n\"But why?\"  \"You must take me with you. I am sa fer with you, and you shall be safer, \\ntoo.\"  \\n\"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest \\nduty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of \\nus from from circumstances things that have been.\" He paused \\nembarrassed.  \\nAs she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead. \"I know. \\nThat is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up. I may \\nnot be able again. I know that when the Count wills me I must go. I know that \\nif he tells me to come in secret, I must  by wile. By any device to hoodwink, \\neven Jonathan.\" God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if \\nthere be indeed a Recording Angel that lo ok is noted to her ever-lasting honour. \\nI could only clasp her hand. I could not speak. My emotion was too great for \\neven the relief of tears.  \\nShe went on. \"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your \\nnumbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance \\nof one who had to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotize me and so learn that w hich even I myself do not know.\"  \\nDr. Van Helsing said gravely, \"Madam  Mina, you are, as always, most \\nwise. You shall with us come. And togeth er we shall do that which we go forth \\nto achieve.\"  \\nWhen he had spoken, Mina\\'s long spel l of silence made me look at her. \\nShe had fallen back on her pillow asleep . She did not even wake when I had \\npulled up the blind and let in the sunlig ht which flooded the room. Van Helsing \\nmotioned to me to come with him quietly.  We went to his room, and within a \\nminute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.  \\nHe told them what Mina had said, and went on. \"In the morning we shall \\nleave for Varna. We have now to deal  with a new factor, Madam Mina. Oh, but \\nher soul is true. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as sh e has done. But it is \\nmost right, and we are warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in \\nVarna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.\"  \\n\"What shall we do exactly?\" asked Mr. Morris laconically.  \\nThe Professor paused before replying, \"We shall at the first board that ship. \\nThen, when we have identified the box, we  shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge, so that at least \\nsays the superstition. And to superstition mu st we trust at the first. It was man\\'s \\nfaith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then, when we get the \\nopportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, \\nand and all will be well.\"  \\n\"I shall not wait for a ny opportunity,\" said Morris. \"When I see the box I \\nshall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men \\nlooking on, and if I am to be wiped ou t for it the next moment!\" I grasped his \\nhand instinctively and found it as firm as  a piece of steel. I think he understood \\nmy look. I hope he did.  \\n\"Good boy,\" said Dr. Van Helsing. \"Bra ve boy. Quincey is all man. God \\nbless him for it. My child, believe me none  of us shall lag behind or pause from \\nany fear. I do but say what we may do what we must do. But, indeed, indeed \\nwe cannot say what we may do. There are so many things which may happen, \\nand their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways. And when the time for the end has \\ncome, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us today put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete. For none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As \\nfor me, my own affairs are regulate, and as  I have nothing else to do, I shall go \\nmake arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets an d so forth for our \\njourney.\"  \\nThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle up \\nall my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come.  \\nLater.--It is done. My will is made, and all complete. Mina if she survive is \\nmy sole heir. If it should not be so, then  the others who have been so good to us \\nshall have remainder.  \\nIt is now drawing towards the sunset. Mina\\'s uneasiness calls my attention \\nto it. I am sure that there is somethin g on her mind which the time of exact \\nsunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all. \\nFor each sunrise and sunset opens up so me new danger, some new pain, which \\nhowever, may in God\\'s will be means to a go od end. I write all these things in \\nthe diary since my darling must not h ear them now. But if it may be that she \\ncan see them again, they shall be  ready. She is calling to me.   \\nCHAPTER 25  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n11 Octobe\\nr, Evening.--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he \\nsays he is hardly equal to the task, an d he wants an exact record kept.  \\nI think that none of us were surpri sed when we were asked to see Mrs. \\nHarker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom. When her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or  restraining her, or \\ninciting her to action. This mood or cond ition begins some half hour or more \\nbefore actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the \\nclouds are still aglow with the rays stre aming above the horizon. At first there \\nis a sort of negative condition, as if  some tie were loosened, and then the \\nabsolute freedom quickly follows. Wh en, however, the freedom ceases the \\nchange back or relapse comes quickly,  preceded only by a spell of warning \\nsilence.  \\nTonight, when we met, she was some what constrained, and bore all the \\nsigns of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so.  \\nA very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself. Then, \\nmotioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half \\nreclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close.  \\nTaking her husband\\'s hand in hers, she began, \"We are all here together in \\nfreedom, for perhaps the last time! I know  that you will always be with me to \\nthe end.\" This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened \\nupon her. \"In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what \\nmay be in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me to take me \\nwith you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, \\nwhose soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet,  but is at any rate at stake, you will \\ndo. But you must remember that I am not  as you are. There is a poison in my \\nblood, in my soul, which may destroy me, which must destroy me, unless some \\nrelief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at \\nstake. And though I know there is one wa y out for me, you mu st not and I must not take it!\" She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginn ing and ending with \\nher husband.  \\n\"What is that way?\" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. \"What is that \\nway, which we must not, may not, take?\"  \\n\"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the \\ngreater evil is entirely wrought. I kn ow, and you know, that were I once dead \\nyou could and would set free my immortal  spirit, even as you did my poor \\nLucy\\'s. Were death, or the fear of death,  the only thing that stood in the way I \\nwould not shrink to die here now, amidst the friends who love me. But death is \\nnot all. I cannot believe that to die in such  a case, when there is hope before us \\nand a bitter task to be done, is God\\'s w ill. Therefore, I on my part, give up here \\nthe certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest \\nthings that the world or the  nether world holds!\"  \\nWe were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. \\nThe faces of the others were set, and Harker\\'s grew ashen grey. Perhaps, he \\nguessed better than any of us what was coming.  \\nShe continued, \"This is what I can gi ve into the hotch-pot.\" I could not but \\nnote the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all \\nseriousness. \"What will ea ch of you give? Your li ves I know,\" she went on \\nquickly, \"that is easy for brave men. Y our lives are God\\'s,  and you can give \\nthem back to Him, but what will you give to me?\" She looked again \\nquestioningly, but th is time avoided her husband\\'s face. Quincey seemed to \\nunderstand, he nodded, and her face lit up. \"Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful ma tter in this connection between us now. \\nYou must promise me, one and all, even you, my beloved husband, that should \\nthe time come, you will kill me.\"  \\n\"What is that time?\" The voice was Q uincey\\'s, but it was low and strained.  \\n\"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I \\ndie that I may live. When I am thus dead in  the flesh, then you will, without a \\nmoment\\'s delay, drive a stake through me  and cut off my head, or do whatever \\nelse may be wanting to give me rest!\"  \\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her and \\ntaking her hand in his said solemnly, \"I\\'m only a rough fellow, who hasn\\'t, \\nperhaps, lived as a man should to w in such a distinction,  but I swear to you by \\nall that I hold sacred and dear that, shou ld the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all \\ncertain, for if I am only doubtful I shal l take it that the time has come!\"  \\n\"My true friend!\" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as \\nbending over, she kissed his hand.  \\n\"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\" said Van Helsing. \"And I!\" \\nsaid Lord Godalming, each  of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath. I \\nfollowed, myself.  \\nThen her husband turned to her wan-ey ed and with a green ish pallor which \\nsubdued the snowy whiteness of his hair , and asked, \"And must I, too, make \\nsuch a promise, oh, my wife?\"  \\n\"You too, my dearest,\" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice \\nand eyes. \"You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and all the world \\nto me. Our souls are knit into one, for al l life and all time. Think, dear, that \\nthere have been times when brave me n have killed their wives and their \\nwomenkind, to keep them from falling int o the hands of the enemy. Their \\nhands did not falter any the more because  those that they loved implored them \\nto slay them. It is men\\'s duty towards th ose whom they love, in such times of \\nsore trial! And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let \\nit be at the hand of him that loves me  best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not \\nforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy\\'s case to him who loved.\" She stopped with \\na flying blush, and changed her phrase, \"to him who had best right to give her \\npeace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory \\nof my husband\\'s life that it was his lo ving hand which set me free from the \\nawful thrall upon me.\"  \\n\"Again I swear!\" came the Professor\\'s resonant voice.  \\nMrs. Harker smiled, posit ively smiled, as with a si gh of relief she leaned \\nback and said, \"And now one word of  warning, a warnin g which you must \\nnever forget. This time, if it ever co me, may come quickly and unexpectedly, \\nand in such case you must lose no time in using your opportu nity. At such a \\ntime I myself might be nay! If the tim e ever come, shall be, leagued with \\nyour enemy against you.  \\n\"One more request,\" she became very so lemn as she said this, \"it is not \\nvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you \\nwill.\"  We all acquiesced, but no one spoke. There was no need to speak.  \\n\"I want you to read the Burial Service.\" She was interrupted by a deep \\ngroan from her husband. Taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and \\ncontinued. \"You must read it over me so me day. Whatever may be the issue of \\nall this fearful state of thin gs, it will be a sweet thought  to all or some of us. \\nYou, my dearest, will I hope read it, fo r then it will be in your voice in my \\nmemory forever, come what may!\"  \\n\"But oh, my dear one,\" he pleaded, \"death is afar off from you.\"  \\n\"Nay,\" she said, holding up a warning hand . \"I am deeper in death at this \\nmoment than if the weight of an ear thly grave lay heavy upon me!\"  \\n\"Oh, my wife, must I read it?\"  he said, before he began.  \\n\"It would comfort me, my husband!\" was all she said, and he began to read \\nwhen she had got the book ready.  \\nHow can I, how could anyone, tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its \\ngloom, its sadness, its horror, and withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who \\ncan see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, \\nwould have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and \\ndevoted friends kneeling round that strick en and sorrowing lady; or heard the \\ntender passion of her husba nd\\'s voice, as in tones so broken and emotional that \\noften he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial \\nof the Dead. I cannot go on words and v-voices f-fail m-me!  \\nShe was right in her instinct. Strange as  it was, bizarre as it may hereafter \\nseem even to us who felt its potent influe nce at the time, it comforted us much. \\nAnd the silence, which showed Mrs. Ha rker\\'s coming relapse from her freedom \\nof soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n15 October, Varna.--We left Charing Cr oss on the morning of the 12th, got \\nto Paris the same night, and took the place s secured for us in the Orient Express. \\nWe traveled night and day, arriving here at about five o\\'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram  had arrived for him, whilst the rest \\nof us came on to this hotel, \"the Odessu s.\" The journey may have had incidents. \\nI was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the Czarina \\nCatherine comes into port there will be no  interest for me in anything in the \\nwide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger. Her \\ncolour is coming back. She sleeps a great deal. Throughout the journey she \\nslept nearly all the time. Before sunr ise and sunset, however, she is very \\nwakeful and alert. And it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her \\nat such times. At first, some effort  was needed, and he had to make many \\npasses. But now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habi t, and scarcely any \\naction is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to \\nsimply will, and her thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see \\nand hear.  \\nShe answers to the first, \"Nothing, all is dark.\"  \\nAnd to the second, \"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the \\nwater rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The \\nwind is high I can hear it in the shroud s, and the bow throws back the foam.\"  \\nIt is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on her way \\nto Varna. Lord Godalming has just return ed. He had four telegrams, one each \\nday since we started, and all to the same  effect. That the Czarina Catherine had \\nnot been reported to Lloyd\\'s from anyw here. He had arranged before leaving \\nLondon that his agent should send him every day a te legram saying if the ship \\nhad been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a wa tch being kept at the  other end of the \\nwire.  \\nWe had dinner and went to bed early. Tomorrow we are to see the Vice \\nConsul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as \\nshe arrives. Van Helsing says that our ch ance will be to get on the boat between \\nsunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he  takes the form of a bat, cannot cross \\nthe running water of his ow n volition, and so cannot l eave the ship. As he dare \\nnot change to man\\'s form without suspic ion, which he evidently wishes to \\navoid, he must remain in the box. If, the n, we can come on board after sunrise, \\nhe is at our mercy, for we can open the  box and make sure of him, as we did of \\npoor Lucy, before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us all will not count for much. We think that we shall not ha ve much trouble with officials or the \\nseamen. Thank God! This is the country where bribery can do anything, and we \\nare well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunr ise without our being warned, and we \\nshall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!  \\n16 October.--Mina\\'s report still the same. Lapping waves and rushing \\nwater, darkness and favouring winds. We  are evidently in good time, and when \\nwe hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready. As she must pass the \\nDardanelles we are sure to have some report.  \\n17 October.--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the \\nCount on his return from his  tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied \\nthat the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, \\nand got a half consent that he might op en it at his own risk. The owner gave \\nhim a paper telling the Captain to give him  every facility in doing whatever he \\nchose on board the ship, and also a sim ilar authorization to hi s agent at Varna. \\nWe have seen the agent, who was much impressed w ith Godalming\\'s kindly \\nmanner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our \\nwishes will be done.  \\nWe have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the \\nCount is there, Van Helsin g and Seward will cut off his  head at once and drive \\na stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent \\ninterference, even if we have to use th e arms which we shall have ready. The \\nProfessor says that if we can so treat the Count\\'s body, it will soon after fall \\ninto dust. In such case there would be  no evidence against us, in case any \\nsuspicion of murder were aroused. But ev en if it were not, we should stand or \\nfall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come \\nbetween some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out \\nour intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the Czarina \\nCatherine is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.  \\n24 October.--A whole week of waitin g. Daily telegrams to Godalming, but \\nonly the same story. \"Not yet reported. \" Mina\\'s morning and evening hypnotic \\nanswer is unvaried. Lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.   \\nTELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH RUFUS SMITH, LLOYD\\'S, LONDON, \\nTO LORD GODALMING, CARE OF H. B. M. VICE CONSUL, VARNA  \\n\"Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n25 October.--How I miss my phonograph!  To write a diary with a pen is \\nirksome to me! But Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement \\nyesterday when Godalming got his telegr am from Lloyd\\'s. I know now what \\nmen feel in battle when the call to actio n is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our \\nparty, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did \\nnot, for we took special care not to let he r know anything about it, and we all \\ntried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she \\nwould, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it. But in this way she is greatly chan ged during the past three weeks. The \\nlethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting \\nback some of her colour, Van Helsing an d I are not satisfied. We talk of her \\noften. We have not, however, said a wo rd to the others. It would break poor \\nHarker\\'s heart, certainly his nerve, if he knew that we had even a suspicion on \\nthe subject. Van Helsing exam ines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst \\nshe is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a ch ange in her. If this change should come, \\nit would be necessary to take steps! We both know what those steps would \\nhave to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should \\nneither of us shrink from the ta sk, awful though it be to contemplate. \\n\"Euthanasia\" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.  \\nIt is only about 24 hours\\' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the \\nCzarina Catherine has come from Londo n. She should therefore arrive some \\ntime in the morning, but as she cannot possibly get in before noon, we are all \\nabout to retire early. We shall get up at one o\\'clock, so as to be ready.  \\n 25 October, Noon.--No news yet of the  ship\\'s arrival. Mrs. Harker\\'s \\nhypnotic report this mornin g was the same as usual, so it is possible that we \\nmay get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of excitement, except \\nHarker, who is calm. His hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him \\nwhetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with \\nhim. It will be a bad lookout for the C ount if the edge of that \"Kukri\" ever \\ntouches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!  \\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarme d about Mrs. Harker today. About \\nnoon she got into a sort of lethargy whi ch we did not like. Although we kept \\nsilence to the others, we were neithe r of us happy about it. She had been \\nrestless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was \\nsleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he  could not wake her, we went to her room to see for \\nourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so well an d peaceful that we \\nagreed that the sleep was better for her th an anything else. P oor girl, she has so \\nmuch to forget that it is no wonder that sl eep, if it brings ob livion to her, does \\nher good.  \\nLater.--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some \\nhours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days. \\nAt sunset she made the usual hypnotic re port. Wherever he may be in the Black \\nSea, the Count is hurrying to his de stination. To his doom, I trust!  \\n26 October.--Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine. She \\nought to be here by now. That  she is still journeying so mewhere is apparent, for \\nMrs. Harker\\'s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same. It is possible that \\nthe vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog. Some of the steamers which came \\nin last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We \\nmust continue our watching, as the sh ip may now be signal led any moment.  \\n27 October, Noon.--Most strange. No news yet of the ship we wait for. \\nMrs. Harker reported last night and this  morning as usual. \"Lapping waves and \\nrushing water,\" though she added that \"the waves were very faint.\" The \\ntelegrams from London have been the same , \"no further report.\" Van Helsing is \\nterribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears th e Count is escaping us.  He added significantly, \"I did not l ike that lethargy of Madam Mina\\'s. \\nSouls and memories can do strange thi ngs during trance.\" I was about to ask \\nhim more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We \\nmust try tonight at sunset to make he r speak more fully when in her hypnotic \\nstate.  \\n28 October.--Telegram. Rufus Smith, L ondon, to Lord Godalming, care H. \\nB. M. Vice Consul, Varna  \\n\"Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o\\'clock today.\"  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n28 October.--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I \\ndo not think it was such a s hock to any of us as might have been expected. True, \\nwe did not know whence, or how, or wh en, the bolt would come. But I think \\nwe all expected that something strange would happen. The day of arrival at \\nVarna made us individually satisfied that things woul d not be just as we had \\nexpected. We only waited to learn wher e the change would occur. None the \\nless, however, it was a surprise. I suppos e that nature works on such a hopeful \\nbasis that we believe against ourselves tha t things will be as they ought to be, \\nnot as we should know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the \\nangels, even if it be a will-o\\'-the-wisp to  man. Van Helsing raised his hand over \\nhis head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty. But he \\nsaid not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set.  \\nLord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself \\nhalf stunned and looked in wonder at  one after another. Quincey Morris \\ntightened his belt with that quick m ovement which I knew so well. In our old \\nwandering days it meant \"action.\" Mrs.  Harker grew ghastly white, so that the \\nscar on her forehead seemed to burn , but she folded her hands meekly and \\nlooked up in prayer. Harker smiled, actual ly smiled, the dark, bitter smile of \\none who is without hope, but at the same  time his action be lied his words, for \\nhis hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there.  \\n\"When does the next train start for Galatz?\" said Van Helsing to us \\ngenerally.  \"At 6:30 tomorrow morning!\" We all st arted, for the answer came from \\nMrs. Harker.  \\n\"How on earth do you know?\" said Art.  \\n\"You forget, or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so \\ndoes Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the trai n fiend. At home in Exeter I always \\nused to make up the time tables, so as to  be helpful to my husband. I found it so \\nuseful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time tables now. I knew \\nthat if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at \\nany rate through Bucharest, so I lear ned the times very carefully. Unhappily \\nthere are not many to learn, as the onl y train tomorrow leaves as I say.\"  \\n\"Wonderful woman!\" murmured the Professor.  \\n\"Can\\'t we get a special?\" asked Lord Godalming.  \\nVan Helsing shook his head, \"I fear not.  This land is very different from \\nyours or mine. Even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as \\nsoon as our regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must \\nthink. Now let us organize. You, frie nd Arthur, go to the train and get the \\ntickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning.  Do you, friend \\nJonathan, go to the agent of the ship an d get from him letters to the agent in \\nGalatz, with authority to make a search of the ship just as it was here. Quincey \\nMorris, you see the Vice C onsul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and \\nall he can do to make our way smooth, so  that no times be lost when over the \\nDanube. John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so \\nif time be long you may be delayed. An d it will not matter when the sun set, \\nsince I am here with Madam to make report.\"  \\n\"And I,\" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had \\nbeen for many a long day, \"shall try to be  of use in all ways , and shall think and \\nwrite for you as I used to do. Something is shifting from me in some strange \\nway, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\"  \\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to \\nrealize the significance of her words. But Van Helsing and I, turning to each \\nother, met each a grave and troubled gla nce. We said nothing at the time, \\nhowever.  When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs. \\nHarker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harker\\'s \\njournal at the Castle. She went away to get it.  \\nWhen the door was shut upon her he said to me, \"We mean the same! \\nSpeak out!\"  \\n\"Here is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive \\nus.\"  \\n\"Quite so. Do you know why I aske d her to get the manuscript?\"  \\n\"No!\" said I, \"unless it was to get an  opportunity of seeing me alone.\"  \\n\"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell you \\nsomething. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great, a terrible, risk. But I believe \\nit is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both \\nour understanding, an ins piration came to me. In the trance of three days ago \\nthe Count sent her his spirit to read her mind. Or more like he took her to see \\nhim in his earth box in the ship  with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and \\nset of sun. He learn then that we are here, for she have more to tell in her open \\nlife with eyes to see ears to hear than he, shut as he is, in his coffin box. Now \\nhe make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.  \\n\"He is sure with his so great knowledg e that she will come at his call. But \\nhe cut her off, take her, as he can do , out of his own power, that so she come \\nnot to him. Ah! There I have hope that our man brains that have been of man so \\nlong and that have not lost the grace of  God, will come higher than his child-\\nbrain that lie in his tomb for centuries, th at grow not yet to ou r stature, and that \\ndo only work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina. Not a word to her of her trance! She knows it not, and it would overwhelm her and \\nmake despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage, when most we \\nwant all her great brain which is trai ned like man\\'s brain, but is of sweet \\nwoman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may \\nnot take away altogether, though he th ink not so. Hush! Let me speak, and you \\nshall learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in  awful straits. I fear, as I never feared \\nbefore. We can only trust the good God. Silence! Here she comes!\"  \\nI thought that the Professor was goin g to break down and have hysterics, \\njust as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and \\nwas at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright \\nand happy looking and, in the doing of wo rk, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of  sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. \\nHe looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read.  \\nThen holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said, \"Friend \\nJohn, to you with so much experience alre ady, and you too, dear Madam Mina, \\nthat are young, here is a lesson. Do not fear ever to think. A half thought has \\nbeen buzzing often in my brain, but I f ear to let him loose his wings. Here now, \\nwith more knowledge, I go back to wher e that half thought come from and I \\nfind that he be no half thought at all. That  be a whole thought, though so young \\nthat he is not yet strong to use his little  wings. Nay, like the \\'Ugly Duck\\' of my \\nfriend Hans Andersen, he be no duck thoug ht at all, but a big swan thought that \\nsail nobly on big wings, wh en the time come for him to try them. See I read \\nhere what Jonathan have written.  \\n\"That other of his race w ho, in a later age, aga in and again, brought his \\nforces over The Great River into Turkey Land, who when he was beaten back, \\ncame again, and again, and again, th ough he had to come alone from the \\nbloody field where his troops were bei ng slaughtered, since he knew that he \\nalone could ultimately triumph.  \\n\"What does this tell us? Not much? No! The Count\\'s child thought see \\nnothing, therefore he speak so free. Your man thought see nothing. My man \\nthought see nothing, till just now. No ! But there comes another word from \\nsome one who speak without th ought because she, too, know not what it mean, \\nwhat it might mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature\\'s course they move on their way and they touch, the pouf! And there comes a \\nflash of light, heaven w ide, that blind and kill and de stroy some. But that show \\nup all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To \\nbegin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? \\'Y es\\' and \\'No.\\' You, John, \\nyes, for it is a study of insanity. You,  no, Madam Mina, for crime touch you not, \\nnot but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad \\nuniversale. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all \\ncountries and at all times, that even  police, who know not much from \\nphilosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is. That is to be empiric. The \\ncriminal always work at one crime, that is the true criminal who seems \\npredestinate to crime, and who will of  none other. This criminal has not full \\nman brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful, but he  be not of man \\nstature as to brain. He be of child brai n in much. Now this criminal of ours is \\npredestinate to crime also. He, too, have child brain, and it is of the child to do \\nwhat he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the littl e animal learn not by \\nprinciple, but empirically. And when he learn to do, then there is to him the \\nground to start from to do more. \\'Dos pou sto,\\' said Archimedes. \\'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!\\' To  do once, is the fulcrum whereby child \\nbrain become man brain. A nd until he have the purpose to do more, he continue \\nto do the same again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I \\nsee that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the \\nleagues,\" for Mrs. Harker began to clap  her hands and her eyes sparkled.  \\nHe went on, \"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what \\nyou see with those so bright eyes.\" He  took her hand and held it whilst he \\nspoke. His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and \\nunconsciously, as she spoke.  \\n\"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso \\nwould so classify him, and qua criminal he  is of an imperfectly formed mind. \\nThus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource  in habit. His past is a clue, and the \\none page of it that we know, and that from  his own lips, tell s that once before, \\nwhen in what Mr. Morris would call a \\'tight place,\\' he went back to his own \\ncountry from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing \\npurpose, prepared himself for a new effo rt. He came again better equipped for \\nhis work, and won. So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, \\nand when all hope of success was lost, a nd his existence in danger, he fled back \\nover the sea to his home. Just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land.\"  \\n\"Good, good! Oh, you so clever lady!\" said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, \\nas he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick room  consultation, \"Sev enty-two only, and \\nin all this excitement. I have hope.\"  \\nTurning to her again, he said with keen expectation, \"But go on. Go on! \\nThere is more to tell if you will. Be  not afraid. John and I know. I do in any \\ncase, and shall tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!\"  \\n\"I will try to. But you will forgive me if I seem too egotistical.\"  \\n\"Nay! Fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\"  \\n\"Then, as he is criminal he is selfis h. And as his intellect is small and his \\naction is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to \\npieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness \\nfrees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on \\nthat dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it!  Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that aw ful hour. And all that haunts me is a \\nfear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his \\nends.\"  \\nThe Professor stood up, \"He has so used  your mind, and by it he has left us \\nhere in Varna, whilst the ship that carri ed him rushed through enveloping fog \\nup to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had ma de preparation for escaping from us. \\nBut his child mind only saw so far. And it may be that as ever is in God\\'s \\nProvidence, the very thing that the evil doer most reckoned on for his selfish \\ngood, turns out to be his chie fest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as \\nthe great Psalmist says. Fo r now that he think he is free from every trace of us \\nall, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child \\nbrain will whisper him to sleep. He think,  too, that as he cut himself off from \\nknowing your mind, there can be no know ledge of him to you. There is where \\nhe fail! That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go \\nto him in spirit, as you have as yet done  in your times of freedom, when the sun \\nrise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his. And this \\npower to good of you and ot hers, you have won from  your suffering at his \\nhands. This is now all more precious th at he know it not, and to guard himself \\nhave even cut himself off from his k nowledge of our where. We, however, are \\nnot selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and \\nthese many dark hours. We shall follow him, and we shall not flinch, even if \\nwe peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this  has been a great \\nhour, and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and \\nwrite him all down, so that when the othe rs return from their work you can give \\nit to them, then they shall know as we do.\"  \\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has \\nwritten with the typewriter all s ince she brought the MS to us.  \\nCHAPTER 26  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n29 Octobe\\nr.--This is written in the tra in from Varna to Galatz. Last night \\nwe all assembled a little before the tim e of sunset. Each of  us had done his \\nwork as well as he could, so far as thou ght, and endeavour, and opportunity go, \\nwe are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mr s. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort, and after a longer and mo re serious effort on the part of Van \\nHelsing than has been usua lly necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she \\nspeaks on a hint, but this tim e the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask \\nthem pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything. At last her answer came.  \\n\"I can see nothing. We are still. There are no waves lapping, but only a \\nsteady swirl of water softly running agai nst the hawser. I can hear men\\'s voices \\ncalling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A gun is \\nfired somewhere, the echo of it seems far away. There is tramping of feet \\noverhead, and ropes and chains are drag ged along. What is this? There is a \\ngleam of light. I can feel the air blowing upon me.\"  \\nHere she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on \\nthe sofa, and raised both her hands, palm s upwards, as if lifting a weight. Van \\nHelsing and I looked at each other wi th understanding. Quincey raised his \\neyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker\\'s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. Ther e was a long pause. We all knew that the \\ntime when she could speak was passing, but we felt that it was useless to say anything.  \\nSuddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes  said sweetly, \"Would \\nnone of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\"  \\nWe could only make her happy, and so  acqueisced. She bustled off to get \\ntea. When she had gone Van Helsing said , \"You see, my friends. He is close to \\nland. He has left his earth chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he \\nmay lie hidden somewhere, but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do \\nnot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, \\nchange his form and jump or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot \\nescape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box \\ncontain. Thus, in fine, if he escape n ot on shore tonight, or before dawn, there \\nwill be the whole day lost to him. We ma y then arrive in time. For if he escape \\nnot at night we shall come on him in da ytime, boxed up and at our mercy. For \\nhe dare not be his true self, awake a nd visible, lest he be discovered.\"  \\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn, at \\nwhich time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.  \\nEarly this morning we listened, with brea thless anxiety, for her response in \\nher trance. The hypnotic stage was ev en longer in coming than before, and \\nwhen it came the time remaining until full  sunrise was so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw hi s whole soul into the effort. At last, \\nin obedience to his will she made reply.  \\n\"All is dark. I hear lapping water, le vel with me, and some creaking as of \\nwood on wood.\" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till tonight.  \\nAnd so it is that we are travel ling towards Galatz in an agony of \\nexpectation. We are due to arrive be tween two and three in the morning. But \\nalready, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till \\nwell after sunup. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. \\nHarker! Either or both may possibly throw  more light on what is happening.  \\nLater.--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when \\nthere was no distraction. For had it occurr ed whilst we were at a station, we \\nmight not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded \\nto the hypnotic influence even less read ily than this morning. I am in fear that \\nher power of reading the Count\\'s sensat ions may die away, just when we want \\nit most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has c onfined herself to the simplest of facts. \\nIf this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count\\'s power \\nover her would die away equally with her power of know ledge it would be a \\nhappy thought. But I am afra id that it may not be so.  \\nWhen she did speak, her words were enigmatical, \"Something is going out. \\nI can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I ca n hear, far off, confused sounds, as of \\nmen talking in strange tongues, fierce falling water, and the howling of \\nwolves.\" She stopped and a shudder ran th rough her, increasi ng in intensity for \\na few seconds, till at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, \\neven in answer to the Professor\\'s impera tive questioning. When she woke from \\nthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid, b ut her mind was all alert. \\nShe could not remember anything, but as ked what she had said. When she was \\ntold, she pondered over it deeply  for a long time and in silence.  \\n30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to \\nwrite later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procurin g the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began \\nhis passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a s till greater difficulty, only a minute \\nbefore the sun rose. The Professor lost no time in his questioning.  \\nHer answer came with equal quickness, \"All is dark. I hear water swirling \\nby, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. \\nThere is another sound, a queer one l ike\" She stopped and grew white, and \\nwhiter still.  \\n\"Go on, go on! Speak, I command you!\" said Van Helsing in an agonized \\nvoice. At the same time there was desp air in his eyes, for the risen sun was \\nreddening even Mrs. Harker\\'s  pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started \\nas she said, sweetly and seeming ly with the utmost unconcern.  \\n\"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what  you know I can\\'t? I don\\'t remember \\nanything.\" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning \\nfrom one to the other with a troubled look, \"What have I said? What have I \\ndone? I know nothin g, only that I was lying here , half asleep, and heard you \\nsay \\'go on! speak, I command you!\\' It seemed so funny to hear you order me \\nabout, as if I were a bad child!\"  \\n\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, sadly, \"it is proof, if proof be needed, of how \\nI love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than \\never, can seem so strange because it is  to order her whom I am proud to obey!\"  \\nThe whistles are sounding. We are near ing Galatz. We are on fire with \\nanxiety and eagerness.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the  hotel where our rooms had been \\nordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does \\nnot speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Goda lming went to the Vice Consul, as his \\nrank might serve as an immediate guaran tee of some sort to the official, we \\nbeing in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping \\nagent to learn particulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.  \\n Later.--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice \\nConsul sick. So the routine work has been  attended to by a clerk. He was very \\nobliging, and offered to do  anything in his power.  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n30 October.--At nine o\\'clock Dr. Van He lsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on \\nMessrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the age nts of the London fi rm of Hapgood. \\nThey had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming\\'s \\ntelegraphed request, asking them to show  us any civility in their power. They \\nwere more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the Czarina \\nCatherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbor. There we saw the \\nCaptain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his \\nlife he had never had so favourable a run.  \\n\"Man!\" he said, \"but it made us afeard,  for we expect it  that we should \\nhave to pay for it wi\\' some rare piece o\\' ill luck, so as to keep up the average. \\nIt\\'s no canny to run frae London to the Bl ack Sea wi\\' a wind ahint ye, as though \\nthe Deil himself were blawin\\' on yer sail for his ain purpose. An\\' a\\' the time we \\ncould no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog \\nfell on us and travelled wi\\' us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, \\nthe deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi\\' oot bein\\' able to signal. \\nAn\\' til we came to the Dardanelles and ha d to wait to get our permit to pass, we \\nnever were within hail o\\' aught. At firs t I inclined to slack off sail and beat \\nabout till the fog was lifted. But whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to \\nget us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If \\nwe had a quick voyage it would be no to  our miscredit wi\\' the owners, or no \\nhurt to our traffic, an\\' the Old Mon who had served his ai n purpose wad be \\ndecently grateful to us for no hinderin\\' him.\"  \\nThis mixture of simplicity and cunni ng, of superstition and commercial \\nreasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said, \"Mine friend, that Devil is more \\nclever than he is thought by some, and he  know when he meet his match!\"  \\nThe skipper was not disp leased with the compliment, and went on, \"When \\nwe got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble. Some o\\' them, the \\nRoumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been \\nput on board by a queer lookin\\' old man ju st before we had started frae London. \\nI had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard them against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty \\nquick, but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent \\nsomething, though I wouldn\\'t say it was again the big box. Well, on we went, \\nand as the fog didn\\'t let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us, for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres, well, he would fetch it up a\\'reet. An\\' if he didn\\'t, well, we\\'d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way \\nand deep water all the time. And two days ago, when the mornin\\' sun came \\nthrough the fog, we found ourselves just  in the river opposite Galatz. The \\nRoumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and \\nfling it in the river. I had to argy wi\\' them aboot it wi\\' a handspike. An\\' when \\nthe last o\\' them rose off the deck wi\\' his  head in his hand, I had convinced them \\nthat, evil eye or no evil eye, the property  and the trust of my owners were better \\nin my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the \\ndeck ready to fling in, and as it was mark ed Galatz via Varna, I thocht I\\'d let it \\nlie till we discharged in the port an\\' get rid o\\'t althegither.  We didn\\'t do much \\nclearin\\' that day, an\\' had to remain the nicht at anchor. But in the mornin\\', braw \\nan\\' airly, an hour before sunup, a ma n came aboard wi\\' an order, written to him \\nfrom England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the \\nmatter was one ready to his hand. He had hi s papers a\\' reet, an\\' glad I was to be \\nrid o\\' the dam\\' thing, for I was beginnin\\' masel\\' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil \\ndid have any luggage aboord the ship, I\\' m thinkin\\' it was nane ither than that \\nsame!\"  \\n\"What was the name of the man who took it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing with \\nrestrained eagerness.  \\n\"I\\'ll be tellin\\' ye quick!\" he answ ered, and stepping down to his cabin, \\nproduced a receipt signed \"Immanuel Hilde sheim.\" Burgen-strasse 16 was the \\naddress. We found out that this was all the Captain knew, so with thanks we \\ncame away.  \\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre \\ntype, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were pointed with \\nspecie, we doing the punctuation, and with a little bargaining he told us what he \\nknew. This turned out to be simple but important. He had received a letter from \\nMr. de Ville of London, telling him to re ceive, if possible before sunrise so as \\nto avoid customs, a box whic h would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. \\nThis he was to give in charge to a certa in Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the \\nSlovaks who traded down the river to th e port. He had been paid for his work \\nby an English bank note, which had b een duly cashed for gold at the Danube \\nInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the \\nship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he knew.  We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his \\nneighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone \\naway two days before, no one knew wh ither. This was corroborated by his \\nlandlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the \\nrent due, in English money. This had been between ten and eleven o\\'clock last \\nnight. We were at a standstill again.  \\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that \\nthe body of Skinsky had been found insi de the wall of the churchyard of St. \\nPeter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those \\nwe had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out. \\n\"This is the work of a Slovak!\" We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.  \\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all \\nconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere, but where that \\nmight be we would have to dis cover. With heavy hearts we came home to the \\nhotel to Mina.  \\nWhen we met together, the first thin g was to consult as to taking Mina \\nagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, an d it is at least a \\nchance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my \\npromise to her.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n30 October, evening.--They were so tired  and worn out and dispirited that \\nthere was nothing to be done till they ha d some rest, so I asked them all to lie \\ndown for half an hour whils t I should enter everything up to the moment. I feel \\nso grateful to the man w ho invented the \"Traveller\\'s\" typewriter, and to Mr. \\nMorris for getting this one for me. I s hould have felt quite astray doing the \\nwork if I had to write with a pen  \\nIt is all done. Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what \\nhe must be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and \\nhis whole body appears in collapse. His br ows are knit. His f ace is drawn with \\npain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh! if I could only help  at all. I shall do \\nwhat I can.  \\nI have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I have \\nnot yet seen. Whilst they ar e resting, I shall go over a ll carefully, and perhaps I \\nmay arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to follow the Professor\\'s example, \\nand think without prejudice on the facts before me  \\nI do believe that under God\\'s providence I have made a discovery. I shall \\nget the maps and look over them.  \\nI am more than ever sure that I am r ight. My new conclusion is ready, so I \\nshall get our party together and read it. They can judge it. It is well to be \\naccurate, and every minute is precious.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S MEMORANDUM  \\n(ENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)  \\nGround of inquiry.--Count Dracula\\'s pr oblem is to get back to his own \\nplace.  \\n(a) He must be brought back by some one. This is evident; for had he \\npower to move himself as he wished he co uld go either as man, or wolf, or bat, \\nor in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or interf erence, in the state \\nof helplessness in which he must be, confined as he is between dawn and \\nsunset in his wooden box.  \\n(b) How is he to be taken?--Here a process of exclusions may help us. By \\nroad, by rail, by water?  \\n1. By Road.--There are endless diffic ulties, especially in leaving the city.  \\n(x) There are people. And people ar e curious, and investigate. A hint, a \\nsurmise, a doubt as to what might be  in the box, would destroy him.  \\n(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.  (z) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear. And in order to \\nprevent his being betrayed he has repelled , so far as he can, even his victim, \\nme!  \\n2. By Rail.--There is no one in charge of  the box. It would have to take its \\nchance of being delayed, and delay would  be fatal, with enemies on the track. \\nTrue, he might escape at nig ht. But what would he be, if left in a strange place \\nwith no refuge that he could fly to? This is  not what he intend s, and he does not \\nmean to risk it.  \\n3. By Water.--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger \\nin another. On the water he is powerless except at night. Even  then he can only \\nsummon fog and storm and snow and hi s wolves. But were he wrecked, the \\nliving water would engulf him, helpless, an d he would indeed be lost. He could \\nhave the vessel drive to land, but if it we re unfriendly land, wherein he was not \\nfree to move, his position would still be desperate.  \\nWe know from the record that he was on the water, so what we have to do \\nis to ascertain what water.  \\nThe first thing is to realize exactly what he has done as yet. We may, then, \\nget a light on what his task is to be.  \\nFirstly.--We must differentiate between  what he did in London as part of \\nhis general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to \\narrange as best he could.  \\nSecondly.--We must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we \\nknow of, what he has done here.  \\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to \\nVarna to deceive us lest we should as certain his means of exit from England. \\nHis immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the \\nletter of instructions sent to Immanue l Hildesheim to clear and take away the \\nbox before sunrise. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we \\nmust only guess at, but there must have been some letter or message, since \\nSkinsky came to Hildesheim.  \\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know. The Czarina Catherine \\nmade a phenomenally quick journey. So much so that Captain Donelson\\'s \\nsuspicions were aroused. But his supersti tion united with his canniness played \\nthe Count\\'s game for him, and he ran with  his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count\\'s arrangements were \\nwell made, has been proved. Hildesheim cl eared the box, took it off, and gave \\nit to Skinsky. Skinsk y took it, and here we lose the tr ail. We only know that the \\nbox is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if \\nthere be any, have been avoided.  \\nNow we come to what the Count must ha ve done after his arrival, on land, \\nat Galatz.  \\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunris e the Count could \\nappear in his own form. Here, we ask w hy Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in \\nthe work? In my husband\\'s diary, Skinsk y is mentioned as dealing with the \\nSlovaks who trade down the river to th e port. And the man\\'s remark, that the \\nmurder was the work of a Slovak, showed  the general feeling against his class. \\nThe Count wanted isolation.  \\nMy surmise is this, that in London the  Count decided to get back to his \\ncastle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the \\ncastle by Szgany, and probably they deli vered their cargo to Slovaks who took \\nthe boxes to Varna, for there they were  shipped to London. Thus the Count had \\nknowledge of the persons who could arra nge this service. When the box was on \\nland, before sunrise or after sunset, he  came out from his box, met Skinsky and \\ninstructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. \\nWhen this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, \\nas he thought, by murd ering his agent.  \\nI have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the \\nSlovaks to have ascended is either th e Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the \\ntypescript that in my trance I heard cows  low and water swirling level with my \\nears and the creaking of wood. The Count in  his box, then, was on a river in an \\nopen boat, propelled probably either by oa rs or poles, for the banks are near \\nand it is working against stream. Ther e would be no such if floating down \\nstream.  \\nOf course it may not be either the Sere th or the Pruth, but we may possibly \\ninvestigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, \\nbut the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the \\nBorgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifest ly as close to Dracula\\'s castle as can \\nbe got by water.  \\n MINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--CONTINUED  \\nWhen I had done reading, Jonathan  took me in his arms and kissed me. \\nThe others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said, \"Our \\ndear Madam Mina is once more our teac her. Her eyes have been where we \\nwere blinded. Now we are on the trac k once again, and this time we may \\nsucceed. Our enemy is at his most helple ss. And if we can come on him by day, \\non the water, our task will be over. He ha s a start, but he is powerless to hasten, \\nas he may not leave this bo x lest those who carry hi m may suspect. For them to \\nsuspect would be to prompt them to throw  him in the stream where he perish. \\nThis he knows, and will no t. Now men, to our Council of War, for here and \\nnow, we must plan what each and all shall do.\"  \\n\"I shall get a steam launch and follow him,\" said Lord Godalming.  \\n\"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,\" said Mr. \\nMorris.  \\n\"Good!\" said the Professor, \"both good. But neither must go alone. There \\nmust be force to overcome force if need be. The Slovak is strong and rough, \\nand he carries rude arms.\" All the me n smiled, for amongst them they carried a \\nsmall arsenal.  \\nSaid Mr. Morris, \"I have brought some Winchesters. They are pretty handy \\nin a crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions. He made some requisitions on others  that Mrs. Harker could \\nnot quite hear or understand. We mu st be ready at all points.\"  \\nDr. Seward said, \"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been \\naccustomed to hunt together, and we tw o, well armed, will be a match for \\nwhatever may come along. You must not be alone, Art.  It may be necessary to \\nfight the Slovaks, and a ch ance thrust, for I don\\'t su ppose these fellows carry \\nguns, would undo all our plans. There mu st be no chances, this time. We shall \\nnot rest until the Count\\'s head and body ha ve been separated, and we are sure \\nthat he cannot reincarnate.\"  \\nHe looked at Jonathan as he spoke, a nd Jonathan looked at me. I could see \\nthat the poor dear was torn  about in his mind. Of cour se he wanted to be with \\nme. But then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would \\ndestroy the the Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?)  He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke, \\n\"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for tw ice reasons. First, because you are young \\nand brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last. And again \\nthat it is your right to destroy him. That, which has wrought such woe to you \\nand yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina. She will be my care, if I may. I am \\nold. My legs are not so q uick to run as once. And I am not used to ride so long \\nor to pursue as need be, or to fight wi th lethal weapons. But I can be of other \\nservice. I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger \\nmen. Now let me say that what I would is this. While you, my Lord Godalming \\nand friend Jonathan go in your so swif t little steamboat up the river, and whilst \\nJohn and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will \\ntake Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy\\'s country. Whilst the old \\nfox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape \\nto land, where he dares not raise the lid of  his coffin box lest his Slovak carriers \\nshould in fear leave him to perish, we shall go in the track where Jonathan went, \\nfrom Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, \\nMadam Mina\\'s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way, all \\ndark and unknown otherwise, after the first sunrise when we are near that \\nfateful place. There is much to be done , and other places to be made sanctify, \\nso that that nest of vipers be obliterated.\"  \\nHere Jonathan interrupted him hotly, \"Do you mean to say, Professor Van \\nHelsing, that you would br ing Mina, in her sad case a nd tainted as she is with \\nthat devil\\'s illness, ri ght into the jaws of his deat htrap? Not for the world! Not \\nfor Heaven or Hell!\"  \\nHe became almost speechless for a m inute, and then went on, \"Do you \\nknow what the place is? Have you seen th at awful den of hellish infamy, with \\nthe very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embr yo? Have you felt the Vampire\\'s lips \\nupon your throat?\"  \\nHere he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his \\narms with a cry, \"Oh, my God, what ha ve we done to have this terror upon us?\" \\nand he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery.  \\nThe Professor\\'s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to \\nvibrate in the air, calmed us all.  \\n\"Oh, my friend, it is because I woul d save Madam Mina from that awful \\nplace that I would go. God forbid that I sh ould take her into that place. There is \\nwork, wild work, to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time, and he is strong and \\nsubtle and cunning, he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time \\nour dear one,\" he took my hand, \"w ould come to him to keep him company, \\nand would be as those others  that you, Jonathan, saw. You have told us of their \\ngloating lips. You heard their ribald la ugh as they clutched the moving bag that \\nthe Count threw to them. Y ou shudder, and well may it be. Forgive me that I \\nmake you so much pain, but it is necessary.  My friend, is it not a dire need for \\nthat which I am giving, possib ly my life? If it were that any one went into that \\nplace to stay, it is I who would have  to go to keep them company.\"  \\n\"Do as you will,\" said Jonathan, w ith a sob that shook him all over, \"we \\nare in the hands of God!\"  \\nLater.--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked. \\nHow can women help loving men when they are so earn est, and so true, and so \\nbrave! And, too, it made me think of the  wonderful power of money! What can \\nit not do when basely used. I felt so th ankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and \\nboth he and Mr. Morris, who also has pl enty of money, are willing to spend it \\nso freely. For if they did not, our little  expedition could not start, either so \\npromptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour . It is not three \\nhours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do. And now Lord \\nGodalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to \\nstart at a moment\\'s notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good \\nhorses, well appointed. We have all th e maps and appliances of various kinds \\nthat can be had. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. \\nWe are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and \\nhorses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the \\nmatter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall \\nget on all right. We have all got arms , even for me a large bore revolver. \\nJonathan would not be ha ppy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot \\ncarry one arm that the rest do, the scar on my forehead for bids that. Dear Dr. \\nVan Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves. The weather is getting colder ev ery hour, and there are snow flurries \\nwhich come and go as warnings.  \\nLater.--It took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling. We may never \\nmeet again. Courage, Mina! The Professor is looking at you keenly. His look is a warning. There must be no  tears now, unless it may be  that God will let them \\nfall in gladness.  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of \\nthe steam launch. Lord Godalming is firing  up. He is an experienced hand at \\nthe work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and \\nanother on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that \\nMina\\'s guess was correct, and that if a ny waterway was chosen for the Count\\'s \\nescape back to his Castle, the Sereth an d then the Bistritza at its junction, \\nwould be the one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north \\nlatitude, would be the place chosen for crossing the countr y between the river \\nand the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at \\nnight. There is plenty of water, and the  banks are wide en ough apart to make \\nsteaming, even in the dark, easy enough . Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for \\na while, as it is enough for the prese nt for one to be on watch. But I cannot \\nsleep, how can I with the terrible dang er hanging over my darling, and her \\ngoing out into that awful place  \\nMy only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it \\nwould be easier to die than to live, and so  be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris \\nand Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started. They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to ge t on higher lands where they can see a \\ngood stretch of river and av oid the following of its curves. They have, for the \\nfirst stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses, four in  all, so as not to \\nexcite curiosity. When they dismiss the me n, which shall be sh ortly, they shall \\nthemselves look after the horses.  It may be necessary for us  to join forces. If so \\nthey can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a moveable horn, and \\ncan be easily adapted for Mina, if required.  \\nIt is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through the \\ndarkness, with the cold from the river s eeming to rise up and strike us, with all \\nthe mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be \\ndrifting into unknow n places and unknown ways. In to a whole world of dark \\nand dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door  \\n 31 October.--Still hurrying along. Th e day has come, and Godalming is \\nsleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold, the furnace heat is \\ngrateful, though we have heavy fur coat s. As yet we have passed only a few \\nopen boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like \\nthe size of the one we seek. The men were scared every time we turned our \\nelectric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.  \\n1 November, evening.--No news all da y. We have found nothing of the \\nkind we seek. We have now passed into th e Bistritza, and if we are wrong in \\nour surmise our chance is gone. We have  overhauled every boa t, big and little. \\nEarly this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us \\naccordingly. We saw in this a way of sm oothing matters, so at Fundu, where \\nthe Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we  have overhauled s ince then this trick \\nhas succeeded. We have had every de ference shown to us, and not once any \\nobjection to whatever we chos e to ask or do. Some of the  Slovaks tell us that a \\nbig boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew \\non board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us \\nwhether the boat turned into the Bistritz a or continued on up the Sereth. At \\nFundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the \\nnight. I am feeling very sleepy. The c old is perhaps beginn ing to tell upon me, \\nand nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he shall keep the \\nfirst watch. God bless him for all his go odness to poor dear Mina and me.  \\n2 November, morning.--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not \\nwake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was \\nforgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and \\nlet him watch all night, but he was quite right. I am a new man this morning. \\nAnd, as I sit here and watch him sleeping,  I can do all that is necessary both as \\nto minding the engine, steering, and keepin g watch. I can feel that my strength \\nand energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van \\nHelsing. They should have  got to Veresti about no on on Wednesday. It would \\ntake them some time to get the carriage and horses. So if they had started and \\ntravelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help \\nthem! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster. But we \\ncannot. The engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. \\nSeward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams \\nrunning down the mountains into this river,  but as none of them are very large, at present, at all events, though they are doubtless terrible in winter and when \\nthe snow melts, the horsemen may not have  met much obstruction. I hope that \\nbefore we get to Strasba we may see them. For if by that time we have not \\novertaken the Count, it may be necessary  to take counsel together what to do \\nnext.  \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n2 November.--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it if \\nthere had been, for every moment is pr ecious. We have had only the rest \\nneedful for the horses. But we ar e both bearing it wonderfully. Those \\nadventurous days of ours are turning up  useful. We must push on. We shall \\nnever feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.   \\n3 November.--We heard at Fundu that th e launch had gone up the Bistritza. \\nI wish it wasn\\'t so cold. There are signs of snow coming. And if it falls heavy it \\nwill stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.  \\n4 November.--Today we heard of the launch having been detained by an \\naccident when trying to force a way up the  rapids. The Slovak boats get up all \\nright, by aid of a rope and steering wi th knowledge. Some went up only a few \\nhours before. Godalming is an amateur fi tter himself, and evidently it was he \\nwho put the launch in trim again.  \\nFinally, they got up the rapids all ri ght, with local help, and are off on the \\nchase afresh. I fear that th e boat is not any better for the accident, the peasantry \\ntell us that after she got upon smooth wa ter again, she kept  stopping every now \\nand again so long as she was in sight. We must push on harder than ever. Our \\nhelp may be wanted soon.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  31 October.--Arrived at Veresti at noon.  The Professor tells me that this \\nmorning at dawn he could hardly hypnoti ze me at all, and that all I could say \\nwas, \"dark and quiet.\" He is off now bu ying a carriage and horses. He says that \\nhe will later on try to buy additional ho rses, so that we may be able to change \\nthem on the way. We have something more than 70 miles before us. The \\ncountry is lovely, and most interest ing. If only we were under different \\nconditions, how delightful it would be to  see it all. If Jonathan and I were \\ndriving through it alone what  a pleasure it would be. To  stop and see people, \\nand learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all \\nthe colour and picturesque ness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the \\nquaint people! But, alas!  \\nLater.--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and horses. \\nWe are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The land lady is putting us \\nup a huge basket of provis ions. It seems enough for a company of soldiers. The \\nProfessor encourages her, and whispers to me that it may be a week before we \\ncan get any food again. He has been sh opping too, and has sent home such a \\nwonderful lot of fur coats and wraps, an d all sorts of warm things. There will \\nnot be any chance of our being cold.  \\nWe shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are \\ntruly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with \\nall the strength of my sad and humble so ul, that He will watch over my beloved \\nhusband. That whatever may happen, Jo nathan may know that I loved him and \\nhonoured him more than I can say, and tha t my latest and truest thought will be \\nalways for him.  \\nCHAPTER 27  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n1 Novem\\nber.--All day long we have tr avelled, and at a good speed. The \\nhorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly \\ntheir full stage at best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the \\nsame thing so constantly that we are enco uraged to think that the journey will \\nbe an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he tells the farmers that he is \\nhurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea, and off we go. It is a lovely country. Full of \\nbeauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and \\nsimple, and seem full of nice qualities. Th ey are very, very superstitious. In the \\nfirst house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on \\nmy forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep \\noff the evil eye. I believe they went to the  trouble of putting an extra amount of \\ngarlic into our food, and I can\\'t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care \\nnot to take off my hat or veil, and so  have escaped their suspicions. We are \\ntravelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal. But I daresay that fear of the e vil eye will follow hard behind us all the \\nway. The Professor seems tireless. All da y he would not take  any rest, though \\nhe made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotized me, and he \\nsays I answered as usual, \"darkness, lapping water and creaking wood.\" So our \\nenemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have \\nnow no fear for him, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse \\nfor the horses to be ready. Dr. Van Hels ing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks \\nvery tired and old and grey, but his mout h is set as firmly as a conqueror\\'s. \\nEven in his sleep he is intense with re solution. When we have well started I \\nmust make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, \\nand he must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed All \\nis ready. We are off shortly.  \\n2 November, morning.--I was successf ul, and we took tur ns driving all \\nnight. Now the day is on us, bright though  cold. There is a strange heaviness in \\nthe air. I say heaviness for want of a better word. I mean that it oppresses us \\nboth. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van \\nHelsing hypnotized me. He says I an swered \"darkness, creaking wood and \\nroaring water,\" so the river is chan ging as they ascend. I do hope that my \\ndarling will not run any chance of dange r, more than need be, but we are in \\nGod\\'s hands.  \\n2 November, night.--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as we \\ngo, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Ve resti seemed so far from \\nus and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front. \\nWe both seem in good spirits.  I think we make an effort each to cheer the other, \\nin the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we \\nshall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the \\nProfessor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He got two in addi tion to the two we changed, so that \\nnow we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and \\nthey give us no trouble. We are not worrie d with other travellers, and so even I \\ncan drive. We shall get to the Pass in dayl ight. We do not want to arrive before. \\nSo we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will tomorrow \\nbring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. \\nGod grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over \\nmy husband and those dear to us both, an d who are in such deadly peril. As for \\nme, I am not worthy in His sight. Alas ! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be \\nuntil He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one  of those who have \\nnot incurred His wrath.  \\nMEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING  \\n4 November.--This to my old and tr ue friend John Seward, M.D., of \\nPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is morning, and I \\nwrite by a fire which all the night I have  kept alive, Madam Mina aiding me. It \\nis cold, cold. So cold that the grey he avy sky is full of snow, which when it \\nfalls will settle for all winter as the grou nd is hardening to receive it. It seems \\nto have affected Madam Mina. She has been  so heavy of head all day that she \\nwas not like herself. She sleeps, and sl eeps, and sleeps! She who is usual so \\nalert, have done literally no thing all the day. She even have lost her appetite. \\nShe make no entry into her little diary, sh e who write so faithful at every pause. \\nSomething whisper to me that all is n ot well. However, tonight she is more vif. \\nHer long sleep all day have refresh and re store her, for now she is all sweet and \\nbright as ever. At sunset I try to hy pnotize her, but alas ! with no effect. The \\npower has grown less and le ss with each day, and tonig ht it fail me altogether. \\nWell, God\\'s will be done, whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!  \\nNow to the historical, for as Madam M ina write not in her stenography, I \\nmust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go \\nunrecorded.  \\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunr ise yesterday morning. When I saw \\nthe signs of the dawn I got ready for the  hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, \\nand got down so that there might be no di sturbance. I made a couch with furs, \\nand Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more \\nshort time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came the answer, \"darkness and the swirling of water.\" Th en she woke, bright and radiant and we \\ngo on our way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place, she become all \\non fire with zeal. Some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point \\nto a road and say, \"This is the way.\"  \\n\"How know you it?\" I ask.  \\n\"Of course I know it,\" she answer, and with a pause, add, \"Have not my \\nJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?\"  \\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one \\nsuch byroad. It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from \\nthe Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more  wide and hard, and more of use.  \\nSo we came down this road. When we  meet other ways, not always were \\nwe sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have \\nfallen, the horses know and they only. I g ive rein to them, and they go on so \\npatient. By and by we find all the th ings which Jonathan have note in that \\nwonderful diary of him. Then we go on fo r long, long hours and hours. At the \\nfirst, I tell Madam Mina to sleep. She try, and she succeed. She sleep all the \\ntime, till at the last, I feel myself to su spicious grow, and attempt to wake her. \\nBut she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too \\nhard lest I harm her. For I know that sh e have suffer much, and sleep at times \\nbe all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself , for all of sudden I feel guilt, as \\nthough I have done something. I find myse lf bolt up, with the reins in my hand, \\nand the good horses go along jog, jog,  just as ever. I look down and find \\nMadam Mina still asleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow \\nthe light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so th at we throw great long \\nshadow on where the mountain rise so st eep. For we are going up, and up, and \\nall is oh so wild and rocky, as thou gh it were the end of the world.  \\nThen I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, \\nand then I try to put her to  hypnotic sleep. But she sl eep not, bei ng as though I \\nwere not. Still I try and try,  till all at once I find her and myself in dark, so I \\nlook round, and find that the sun have gone down. Madam Mina laugh, and I \\nturn and look at her. She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw \\nher since that night at Carfax when we  first enter the Count\\'s house. I am \\namaze, and not at ease then.  But she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for \\nme that I forget all fear. I light a fire, fo r we have brought supply of wood with \\nus, and she prepare food while I undo th e horses and set them, tethered in \\nshelter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire she ha ve my supper ready. I go \\nto help her, but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already. That she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not,  and I have grave doubts. But I fear \\nto affright her, and so I am s ilent of it. She help me and I eat alone, and then we \\nwrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But \\npresently I forget all of watching. And when I sudden remember that I watch, I \\nfind her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me w ith so bright eyes. Once, \\ntwice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I \\nwake I try to hypnotize her, but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she \\nmay not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then sleep come to her too \\nlate, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when  I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. \\nMadam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not.  And I am afraid, afraid, afraid! I am afraid of all \\nthings, even to think but I mu st go on my way. The stake we play for is life and \\ndeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.  \\n5 November, morning.--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you \\nand I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think that I, \\nVan Helsing, am mad. That the many hor rors and the so long strain on nerves \\nhas at the last turn my brain.  \\nAll yesterday we travel, always ge tting closer to the mountains, and \\nmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great, frowning \\nprecipices and much falling water, and Na ture seem to have held sometime her \\ncarnival. Madam Mina stil l sleep and sleep. And though I did have hunger and \\nappeased it, I could not waken her, even for food. I began to fear that the fatal \\nspell of the place was upon he r, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. \\n\"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if it be that she sl eep all the day, it shall also be that I \\ndo not sleep at night.\" As we  travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient \\nand imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept.  \\nAgain I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam \\nMina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed. The \\nfrowning mountains seemed further away, a nd we were near the top of a steep \\nrising hill, on summit of which was such a ca stle as Jonathan te ll of in his diary. \\nAt once I exulted and feared. For now, for good or ill, the end was near.  \\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to  hypnotize her, but alas! unavailing \\ntill too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us, for even after down sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the sn ow, and all was for a time in a great \\ntwilight. I took out the horses and fed them in wh at shelter I could. Then I make a fire, and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming \\nthan ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food, but she would not eat, \\nsimply saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her \\nunavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, \\nround where Madam Mina sat. And over the ring I passed some of the wafer, \\nand I broke it fine so that all was well guar ded. She sat still all the time, so still \\nas one dead. And she grew whiter and ev en whiter till the snow was not more \\npale, and no word she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could \\nknow that the poor soul sho ok her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain \\nto feel.  \\nI said to her presently, when she had grown more quie t, \"Will you not \\ncome over to the fire?\" for I wished to make a test of what she could. She rose \\nobedient, but when she have made a step sh e stopped, and stood as one stricken.  \\n\"Why not go on?\" I asked. She shook her head, and coming back, sat down \\nin her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, \\nshe said simply, \"I cannot!\" and remaine d silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that \\nwhat she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might \\nbe danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!  \\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to \\nthem and quieted them. When they did f eel my hands on them, they whinnied \\nlow as in joy, and licked at my ha nds and were quiet for a time. Many times \\nthrough the night did I come to them, ti ll it arrive to the cold hour when all \\nnature is at lowest, and every time my  coming was with quiet of them. In the \\ncold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, \\nfor now the snow came in f lying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the \\ndark there was a light of some kind, as th ere ever is over snow, and it seemed \\nas though the snow flurries and the wr eaths of mist took shape as of women \\nwith trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses \\nwhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear, horrible fears. \\nBut then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began \\ntoo, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the \\nunrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though \\nmy memories of all Jonathan\\'s horrid experience were befooling me. For the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as \\nthough a shadowy glimpse of those wo men that would have kissed him. And \\nthen the horses cowered lower and lowe r, and moaned in terror as men do in \\npain. Even the madness of fright was no t to them, so that they could break \\naway. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me. When I \\nwould have stepped to the fire to reple nish it, she caught me and held me back, \\nand whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was.  \\n\"No! No! Do not go without.  Here you are safe!\"  \\nI turned to her, and looking in her eyes said, \"But you? It is for you that I \\nfear!\"  \\nWhereat she laughed, a laugh low and unreal, and said, \"Fear for me! Why \\nfear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am,\" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, \\nand I see the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would \\nsoon have learned, for the wheeling figur es of mist and snow came closer, but \\nkeeping ever without the Ho ly circle. Then they began to materialize till, if \\nGod have not taken away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes. There were \\nbefore me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, \\nwhen they would have kis sed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the \\nbright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina . And as their laugh came through the \\nsilence of the night, they twined their ar ms and pointed to her, and said in those \\nso sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of \\nthe water glasses, \"Come, si ster. Come to us. Come!\"  \\nIn fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt \\nlike flame. For oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a \\nstory to my heart that was all of hope. G od be thanked she was not, yet, of them. \\nI seized some of the firewood which wa s by me, and holding out some of the \\nWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and \\nlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the  fire, and feared them not. For I knew \\nthat we were safe within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to mo an, and lay still on the ground. The \\nsnow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the \\npoor beasts no more of terror.  \\nAnd so we remained till the red of the  dawn began to fall through the snow \\ngloom. I was desolate and afraid, and fu ll of woe and terror. But when that \\nbeautiful sun began to cl imb the horizon life was to me again. At the first \\ncoming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow. \\nThe wreaths of transparent gloom move d away towards the castle, and were \\nlost.  Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to \\nhypnotize her. But she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could not \\nwake her. I tried to hy pnotize through her sleep, but she made no response, \\nnone at all, and the day br oke. I fear yet to stir. I have made my fire and have \\nseen the horses, they are all dead. Toda y I have much to do here, and I keep \\nwaiting till the sun is up high. For there may be places where I must go, where \\nthat sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.  \\nI will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will do my terrible work. \\nMadam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked! She is calm in her sleep  \\nJONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  4 November, evening.--The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing \\nfor us. Only for it we sh ould have overtaken the boa t long ago, and by now my \\ndear Mina would have been free. I fear  to think of her, off on the wolds near \\nthat horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow on the track. I note this \\nwhilst Godalming is getting ready. We have our arms. The Szgany must look \\nout if they mean to fight. Oh, if only Morri s and Seward were with us. We must \\nonly hope! If I write no more Goodby Mina! God bless and keep you.   \\nDR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY  \\n5 November.--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us \\ndashing away from the river with their leiter wagon. They surrounded it in a \\ncluster, and hurried along as though be set. The snow is falling lightly and there \\nis a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own feelings, but the \\ndepression is strange. Far off I hear the  howling of wolves.  The snow brings \\nthem down from the mountains, and there ar e dangers to all of us, and from all \\nsides. The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off. We ride to death of \\nsome one. God alone knows who, or wher e, or what, or when, or how it may \\nbe  \\nDR. VAN HELSING\\'S MEMORANDUM  5 November, afternoon.--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at \\nall events, though the proving it has been  dreadful. When I left Madam Mina \\nsleeping within the Holy circle, I took  my way to the castle. The blacksmith \\nhammer which I took in the carriage from  Veresti was useful, though the doors \\nwere all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill intent or ill chance \\nshould close them, so that being ente red I might not get out.  Jonathan\\'s bitter \\nexperience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old \\nchapel, for I knew that here my work lay.  The air was oppressive. It seemed as \\nif there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard af ar off the howl of wolves. Then I \\nbethought me of my dear Madam M ina, and I was in terrible plight. The \\ndilemma had me between his horns.  \\nHer, I had not dare to take into this pla ce, but left safe from the Vampire in \\nthat Holy circle. And yet even there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God\\'s will. \\nAt any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had \\nit but been for myself the choice had b een easy, the maw of the wolf were \\nbetter to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.  \\nI knew that there were at least three grav es to find, graves that are inhabit. \\nSo I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that  in the old time, when such things were, many a \\nman who set forth to do such a task as m ine, found at the last his heart fail him, \\nand then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Undead have hypnotize him. And he remain on \\nand on, till sunset come, and the Vam pire sleep be over. Then the beautiful \\neyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the volupt uous mouth present \\nto a kiss, and the man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the \\nVampire fold. One more to swell the grim  and grisly ranks of the Undead!  \\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence \\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with \\nthe dust of centuries, though there be tha t horrid odour such as the lairs of the \\nCount have had. Yes, I was moved. I,  Van Helsing, with all my purpose and \\nwith my motive for hate. I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to \\nparalyze my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need \\nof natural sleep, and the strange oppr ession of the air were beginning to \\novercome me. Certain it was that I was la psing into sleep, the open eyed sleep \\nof one who yields to a sweet fascinatio n, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the \\nsound of a clarion. For it was the voice of  my dear Madam Mina that I heard.  \\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching \\naway tomb tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to \\nlook on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall. \\nBut I go on searching until, pr esently, I find in a high gr eat tomb as if made to \\none much beloved that other fair sist er which, like Jonathan I had seen to \\ngather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exqu isitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in \\nme, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul wail of my dear \\nMadam Mina had not died out of my ear s. And, before the spell could be \\nwrought further upon me, I had nerved myse lf to my wild work. By this time I \\nhad searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell. And as there had been only three of these Undead phantoms around us in  the night, I took it that \\nthere were no more of active Undead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest. Huge it was, a nd nobly proportioned. On it was but one \\nword.  \\nDRACULA \\nThis then was the Undead  home of the King Vampire, to whom so many \\nmore were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew. \\nBefore I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful \\nwork, I laid in Dracula\\'s tomb some of the  Wafer, and so banished him from it, \\nUndead, for ever.  \\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it had \\nbeen easy, comparative. But three! To  begin twice more after I had been \\nthrough a deed of horror. For it was te rrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what \\nwould it not be with these strange one s who had survived through centuries, \\nand who had been strengthened by the pass ing of the years. Wh o would, if they \\ncould, have fought for their foul lives  \\nOh, my friend John, but it was butch er work. Had I not been nerved by \\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I \\ncould not have gone on. I tremble and tr emble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my ne rve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, \\nand the gladness that stole over it just ere the final diss olution came, as \\nrealization that the soul had been won, I could not have  gone further with my \\nbutchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove \\nhome, the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have \\nfled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can \\npity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of \\ndeath for a short moment ere fading. Fo r, friend John, hardly had my knife \\nsevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and \\ncrumble into its native dust, as thou gh the death that should have come \\ncenturies ago had at last as sert himself and say at once and loud, \"I am here!\"  \\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the \\nCount enter there Undead.  \\nWhen I stepped into the circle wher e Madam Mina slept, she woke from \\nher sleep and, seeing me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.  \\n\"Come!\" she said, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet \\nmy husband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She was looking thin and pale and weak. But her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was glad to \\nsee her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that \\nruddy vampire sleep.  \\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full  of fear, we go eastward to meet \\nour friends, and him, whom Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming to \\nmeet us.  \\nMINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL  \\n6 November.--It was late in the afte rnoon when the Professor and I took \\nour way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go \\nfast, though the way was steeply downhill,  for we had to take heavy rugs and \\nwraps with us. We dared not face the pos sibility of being left without warmth \\nin the cold and the snow. We  had to take some of our provisions too, for we \\nwere in a perfect desolation, and so fa r as we could see th rough the snowfall, \\nthere was not even the sign of habitation.  When we had gone about a mile, I \\nwas tired with the heavy walking and sa t down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula\\'s  castle cut the sky. For we were so \\ndeep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the \\nCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a \\nthousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great \\ngap between it and the steep of the ad jacent mountain on any side. There was \\nsomething wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant \\nhowling of wolves. They were far off,  but the sound, even though coming \\nmuffled through the deadeni ng snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the \\nway Dr. Van Helsing was searching abou t that he was trying to seek some \\nstrategic point, where we would be less  exposed in case of  attack. The rough \\nroadway still led downwards. We could trace it through the drifted snow.  \\nIn a little while the Profes sor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. \\nHe had found a wonderful spot, a sort of  natural hollow in a rock, with an \\nentrance like a doorway between two bo ulders. He took me by the hand and \\ndrew me in.  \\n\"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter. And if the wolves do come I \\ncan meet them one by one.\"  \\nHe brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some \\nprovisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat, to even try to do so \\nwas repulsive to me, and much as I woul d have liked to pl ease him, I could not \\nbring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me. \\nTaking his field glasses from the case, he stood on the t op of the rock, and \\nbegan to search the horizon.  \\nSuddenly he called out, \"Look! Madam Mina, look! Look!\"  \\nI sprang up and stood beside him on the rock. He handed me his glasses \\nand pointed. The snow was now falling  more heavily, and swirled about \\nfiercely, for a high wind wa s beginning to blow. However, there were times \\nwhen there were pauses between the s now flurries and I could see a long way \\nround. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance. \\nAnd far off, beyond the white waste of sn ow, I could see the river lying like a \\nblack ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and \\nnot far off, in fact so near that I wondered we had not noticed before, came a \\ngroup of mounted men hurrying along. In  the midst of them was a cart, a long \\nleiter wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog\\'s tail wagging, with each \\nstern inequality of the road. Outlined agai nst the snow as they  were, I could see \\nfrom the men\\'s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.  On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt \\nthat the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew \\nthat at sunset the Thing, which was til l then imprisoned there, would take new \\nfreedom and could in any of many forms elude pursuit. In fear I turned to the \\nProfessor. To my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I \\nsaw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night.  \\nWhen he had completed it he stood beside me again saying, \"At least you \\nshall be safe here from him!\" He took th e glasses from me, and at the next lull \\nof the snow swept the whole space bel ow us. \"See,\" he said, \"they come \\nquickly. They are flogging the horses, a nd galloping as hard as they can.\"  \\nHe paused and went on in a hollow voice,  \"They are racing for the sunset. \\nWe may be too late. God\\'s will be done!\"  Down came another blinding rush of \\ndriving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, \\nhowever, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain.  \\nThen came a sudden cry, \"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow \\nfast, coming up from the south. It must  be Quincey and John. Take the glass. \\nLook before the snow blots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might \\nbe Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off. Looking around I saw on the north side of the com ing party two other men, riding at \\nbreakneck speed. One of them I knew wa s Jonathan, and the other I took, of \\ncourse, to be Lord Godalming. They too,  were pursuing the party with the cart. \\nWhen I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolb oy, and after looking \\nintently till a snow fall ma de sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle \\nready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter.  \\n\"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the time comes we shall have \\ngypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolve r ready to hand, for whilst we were \\nspeaking the howling of wolves came louder  and closer. When the snow storm \\nabated a moment we looked again. It wa s strange to see the snow falling in \\nsuch heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain to ps. Sweeping the glass all \\naround us I could see here and there do ts moving singly and in twos and threes \\nand larger numbers. The wolves were gathering for their prey.  \\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in \\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with  fury as it swept upon us in circling \\neddies. At times we could not see an arm\\' s length before us. But at others, as the hollow sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air space around \\nus so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch \\nfor sunrise and sunset, that we knew w ith fair accuracy when it would be. And \\nwe knew that before long the sun would se t. It was hard to believe that by our \\nwatches it was less than an hour that we  waited in that rocky shelter before the \\nvarious bodies began to converge clos e upon us. The wind came now with \\nfiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly \\nhad driven the snow clouds from us, fo r with only occasional bursts, the snow \\nfell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enou gh those pursued did not seem to realize, or at least \\nto care, that they were pursued. Th ey seemed, however, to hasten with \\nredoubled speed as the sun dropped lo wer and lower on the mountain tops.  \\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind \\nour rock, and held our weapons ready. I could see that he was determined that \\nthey should not pass. One and all were  quite unaware of our presence.  \\nAll at once two voices shouted out to \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan\\'s, \\nraised in a high key of passion. The other Mr. Morris\\' strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have  known the language, but there was \\nno mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively \\nthey reined in, and at the instant Lord  Godalming and Jonath an dashed up at \\none side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other. The leader of the gypsies, \\na splendid looking fellow who sat his ho rse like a centaur, waved them back, \\nand in a fierce voice gave to his comp anions some word to proceed. They \\nlashed the horses which sprang forwar d. But the four men raised their \\nWinchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their \\nreins and drew up. The leader turned to  them and gave a word at which every \\nman of the gypsy party drew what weapon  he carried, knife or pistol, and held \\nhimself in readiness to attack. Issu e was joined in an instant.  \\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, \\nand pointed first to the s un, now close down on the hill tops, and then to the \\ncastle, said something whic h I did not understand. For answer, all four men of \\nour party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seei ng Jonathan in such danger, but that the \\nardor of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them. I felt no \\nfear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick \\nmovement of our parties, the leader of  the gypsies gave a command. His men instantly formed round the cart in a sort  of undisciplined endeavour, each one \\nshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.  \\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jona than on one side of the ring of men, \\nand Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart. It was evident that \\nthey were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing \\nseemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the \\nflashing knives of the gy psies in front, nor the how ling of the wolves behind, \\nappeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan\\'s impetuosity, and the \\nmanifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him. Instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped \\nupon the cart, and with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, \\nand flung it over the wheel to the ground.  In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had \\nto use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had \\nbeen breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,  with the tail of my eye, seen him \\npressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of  the gypsies flash as he \\nwon a way through them, a nd they cut at him. He had parried with his great \\nbowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had co me through in safety. But \\nas he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could \\nsee that with his left hand he was clutchi ng at his side, and that the blood was \\nspurting through his fingers. He did no t delay notwithstanding this, for as \\nJonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he atta cked the other frantically \\nwith his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield. The nails \\ndrew with a screeching so und, and the top of the box was thrown back.  \\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing th emselves covered by the Winchesters, \\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming a nd Dr. Seward, had given in and made \\nno further resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the \\nshadows of the whole group fell upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within \\nthe box upon the earth, some of w hich the rude falling from the cart had \\nscattered over him. He was deathly pale , just like a waxen image, and the red \\neyes glared with the horrible vindicti ve look which I knew so well.  \\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them \\nturned to triumph.  \\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan\\'s great knife. I \\nshrieked as I saw it shear through the throat. Whilst at the same moment Mr. \\nMorris\\'s bowie knife plunge d into the heart.  It was like a miracle, but before our  very eyes, and almost in the drawing \\nof a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.  \\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final \\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of  peace, such as I never could have \\nimagined might have rested there.  \\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky,  and every stone \\nof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun.  \\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary \\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, wi thout a word, and rode away as if for \\ntheir lives. Those who were unmoun ted jumped upon the leiter wagon and \\nshouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, w hich had withdrawn \\nto a safe distance, followed in th eir wake, leaving us alone.  \\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the groun d, leaned on his elbow, holding his \\nhand pressed to his side. The blood still gushed through his fingers. I flew to \\nhim, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors. \\nJonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his \\nshoulder. With a sigh he took, with a f eeble effort, my hand in that of his own \\nwhich was unstained.  \\nHe must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me \\nand said, \"I am only too happy to have be en of service! Oh, God!\" he cried \\nsuddenly, struggling  to a sitting posture and poin ting to me. \"It was worth for \\nthis to die! Look! Look!\"  \\nThe sun was now right down upon th e mountain top, and the red gleams \\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse the men \\nsank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all as their eyes \\nfollowed the pointing of his finger.  \\nThe dying man spoke, \"Now  God be thanked that al l has not been in vain! \\nSee! The snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed \\naway!\"  \\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant \\ngentleman.   \\nNOTE  \\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames. And the happiness of \\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It is an \\nadded joy to Mina and to me that our b oy\\'s birthday is the same day as that on \\nwhich Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend\\'s spirit has passe d into him. His bund le of names links \\nall our little band of men together. But we call him Quincey.  \\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went \\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vi vid and terrible \\nmemories. It was almost impossible to be lieve that the things which we had \\nseen with our own eyes and heard w ith our own ears were living truths. Every \\ntrace of all that had been wa s blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared \\nhigh above a waste of desolation.  \\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time, which we could all \\nlook back on without despair, for G odalming and Seward are both happily \\nmarried. I took the papers from the safe  where they had been ever since our \\nreturn so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material \\nof which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document. Nothing but a mass of type writing, except the later notebooks of Mina and \\nSeward and myself, and Van Helsing\\'s memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. Van \\nHelsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee.  \\n\"We want no proofs. We ask none to believe us! This boy will some day \\nknow what a brave and gallant woma n his mother is. Already he knows her \\nsweetness and loving care. Later on he will understand how so me men so loved \\nher, that they did dare much for her sake.\"  \\nJONATHAN HARKER  ')"
